#'@description The NUCOMBog R package provides an interface to the NUCOMBog model in R.
#'
#'The package simulates the dynamics of five plant functional types (PFTs): graminoids, ericaceous shrubs and three groups of \emph{Sphagnum} mosses (lawn, hollow and hummock mosses) on a monthly time step. The R package also calculates the monthly heterotrophic respiration and therefore the net ecosystem exchange can be calculated.
#'The package provides a user-friendly tool that allows simulating peatlands over years/decades, under different management strategies and climate change scenarios.
