abstract = {(1) Above-ground nutrient turnover and net primary production (NPP) in adjacent wet heathland communities dominated by the evergreen dwarfshrub Erica tetralix and the deciduous perennial grass Molinia caerulea were studied for two years in The Netherlands. (2) The evergreen was able to achieve a high NPP in early spring (March-May), which accounted for 28{\%} of total annual NPP. There was no NPP in winter (October-March). Secondary thickness growth accounted for 31-49{\%} of NPP in the evergreen. (4) The growing season of the deciduous species lasted from April until September. The above-ground NPP was 2.1-2.6 times higher than that of the evergreen. (5) Leaf litter production by the evergreen only occurred during the summer. Leaf litter production of Molinia occurred in autumn. Life expectancy of the leaves was three times as high in the evergreen compared with the deciduous species. (6) The evergreen reduced nutrient losses mainly by leaf longevity, a relatively low allocation of nutrients to the leaves and low tissue nutrient concentrations. The deciduous species reduced nutrient losses mainly by a very efficient retranslocation of nutrients from senescing tissues. (7) Retention of nutrients was greater and NPP was smaller in the evergreen shrub than in the grass. It is suggested that there is a trade-off between these two plant characteristics. (8) It is shown that the differences in nutrient turnover and productivity between Erica and Molinia may explain the replacement of Erica by Molinia in wet heathlands when nutrient availability increases.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of pollutant species in precipitation sampled daily or weekly at 10 sites in Ireland for the five-year period, 1994–1998, is presented. Sea salts accounted for 81{\%} of the total ionic concentration. Approximately 50{\%} of the SO42− in precipitation was from sea-salt sources. The proportion of sea salts in precipitation decreased sharply eastwards. In contrast, the concentration of NO3− and the proportion of non-sea-salt SO42− increased eastwards reflecting the closer proximity to major emission sources. The mean (molc) ratio of SO42−:NO3− was 1.6 for all sites, indicating that SO42− was the major acid anion. The spatial correlation between SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ concentrations in precipitation was statistically significant. The regional trend in NO3− concentration was best described by linear regression against easting. SO42− concentration followed a similar pattern. However, the regression was improved by inclusion of elevation. Inclusion of northing in the regression did not significantly improve any of the relationships except for NH4+, indicating a significant increase in concentrations from northwest to southeast. The spatial distribution of deposition fluxes showed similar gradients increasing from west and southwest to east and northeast. However, the pattern of deposition shows the influence of precipitation volume in determining the overall input. Mean depositions of sulphur and nitrogen in precipitation were ≈30 ktonnes S yr−1 and 48 ktonnes N yr−1 over the five-year period, 1994–1998, for Ireland. Least-squares linear regression analysis indicated a slight decreasing trend in precipitation concentrations for SO42− (20{\%}), NO3− (13{\%}) and H+ (24{\%}) and a slight increasing trend for NH4+ (15{\%}), over the period 1991–1998.},

La Grande Tsa at 2336ma.s.l. is probably the highest bog in the central Swiss Alps and is unique in its pattern. In two of five pools there is in the contact zone between the basal peat and the overlying gyttja an unconformity in the depth-age models based on radiocarbon dates. Palynostratigraphies of cores from a ridge and a pool confirm the occurrence of an unconformity in the contact zone.We conclude that deepening of the pools results from decom- position of peat. The fact that the dated unconformities in the two pools and the unconformity in the ridge-core all fall within the Bronze Age suggest they were caused by events external to the bog.We hypothesize that early transhumance resulted in anthropogenic lowering of the timberline, which resulted in a reduction in the leaf-area index and evapotranspiration, and in higherwater levels and thus pool formation},

abstract = {The organic matter accumulation potential of a restored bog was estimated over 2 years as a balance between losses to decomposition and inputs through above-ground net primary productivity (AGNPP) in five micro-habitats of increasing complexity (relating to the moss carpet thickness and the number of vegetation functional groups). Decomposition and accumulation rates variations were hypothesized to lead to higher organic matter accumulation potential in the more complex micro-habitats. In general, for a given litter type, the mass losses and decomposition rates were rather homogeneous between micro-habitats, but, they were correlated to the cover of particular species: Eriophorum vaginatum with slower decomposition rates, and Ledum groendlandicum or Kalmia angustifolia with higher rates. Therefore, the abundance of some peatland species, rather than the habitat complexity itself, was a driver of decomposition rates. While the Sphagnum AGNPP did not compensate for decomposition losses, the organic matter accumulation potential was tipped towards a sink (positive) by the contribution of vascular species to the AGNPP. The organic matter accumulation potentials are much improved by the presence of Sphagnum, but from a restoration perspective, promoting the growth of vascular peatland species might also be a key to achieving a positive balance of organic matter accumulation.},

abstract = {In this study we applied a modified version of Prelued, a simple semi-empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model, to eight eddy-covariance Italian sites. Since this model has been successfully applied mainly to coniferous forests located at northern latitudes, in our study we aimed to test its generality, by comparing Prelued's outputs in coniferous, broadleaf forests and in a Mediterranean macchia, at different climatic and environmental conditions. The model was calibrated for daily gross primary production (GPP) observed over one year in each flux site and validated for another year. The model uncertainties on both GPP and model parameters were estimated, applying a Bayesian calibration based on a multiple chains Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. The accuracy of the model estimates of daily GPP over the entire period of simulation differed widely depending on the site considered, with generally good model performance when applied to evergreen and broadleaf forests and poor performances in the Mediterranean macchia. The values of the modifiers accounting for the response to climatic variables suggested the soil water content to be non-limiting in temperate mountain evergreen but limiting in Mediterranean forests. Model uncertainties were always smaller than data uncertainties, with variable magnitude depending on the site considered. Both modeled GPP and uncertainties were largely dependent also on uncertainties on the data, which made their calculation a key process in this modelling exercise. In conclusion, this semi-empirical model appears to be suitable for estimating daily and annual forest GPP in most of the considered sites, with the exception of Mediterranean macchias, and for supporting its application to a large range of ecosystems provided a site-specific calibration. The Bayesian calibration did not confer a clear advantage in terms of model performances in respect to other methods used in previous studies, but allowed us to estimate uncertainties on both parameter values and model estimates, which were useful to analyse more in detail the ecosystem response to environmental drivers of GPP.},

This opinion paper provides a perspective on the contributions and future opportunities of the eddy covariance method. First, the paper discusses the pros and cons of this method relative to other methods used to measure the exchange of trace gases between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Second, it discusses how the use of eddy covariance method has grown and evolved. Today, more than 400 flux measurement sites are operating world-wide and the duration of the time series exceed a decade at dozens of sites. Networks of tower sites now enable scientists to ask scientific questions related to climatic and ecological gradients, disturbance, changes in land use, and management. The paper ends with discussions on where the field of flux measurement is heading. Topics discussed include role of open access data sharing and data mining, in this new era of big data, and opportunities new sensors that measure a variety of trace gases, like volatile organic carbon compounds, methane and nitrous oxide, and aerosols, may yield.},

abstract = {We report on methane (CH4) concentrations and efflux densities that were measured over a drained and grazed, peatland pasture in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of California over a three year period. The site was ideal for micrometeorological flux measurements due to its very flat topography, its exposure to vigorous winds and its extended fetch along the predominant wind direction. Nevertheless, the interpretation of methane fluxes with eddy covariance proved to be extremely complicated by a number of geographical, biophysical, biogeochemical and site management factors. Initial inspection of the data revealed unexpected results—methane concentrations and efflux densities were greatest during the night rather than during the day. To explain this odd diurnal behavior in methane efflux densities and concentration, we tested two hypotheses. The prime hypothesis presupposed that the stable stratification of the nocturnal boundary layer elongated the flux footprint and enabled the flux tower to sense wetter fields at the western edge of the pasture, flooded drainage ditches, and/or a tidal marsh upwind of the pasture—these land forms emitted methane at rates 10–100 times greater than the drained portion of the peatland. And, this methane was emitted into a shallower volume of the atmosphere due to the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer, causing methane concentrations to rise faster. The alternative hypothesis attributed the higher nocturnal methane fluxes to cattle, as they may have congregated near the tower at night. We investigated these hypotheses with: (1) a series of micrometeorological field measurements at companion sites upwind and downwind of the pasture; (2) a series of chamber-based flux measurements on the representative land classes; (3) through the lens of a one-dimensional planetary boundary layer (pbl), box model; and (4) via inspection of digital camera images for the presence or absence of cattle. Together, these pieces of data suggest that elevated methane fluxes and concentrations at night were due to the combined correlation between: (1) the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer; (2) the elongation of the flux and concentration footprints; and (3) the preferential sampling of an elevated methane source, be it the cattle, wet proportions of the field or some combination. On the other hand, our flux measurements were not perturbed by methane emanating from the tidal marsh that was several kilometers upwind of the peatland pasture site.},

abstract = {The number of emission measurements of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere has increased greatly in recent years, as recognition of its atmospheric chemical and radiative importance becomes widespread. In this report, we review progress on estimating and understanding both the magnitude of, and controls on, emissions of CH4 from natural wetlands. We also calculate global wetland CH4 emissions using this extensive flux data base and the wetland areas compiled and published by Matthews and Fung (1987). Tropical regions (20° N-30° S) were calculated to release 66 TgCH4/yr, 60{\%} of the total wetland emission of 109 Tg/yr. Flux data from tropical wetlands, reported only within the last four years, are currently restricted in geographic coverage. Additional data from other regions will be required to confirm these calculated large emissions. Although emissions from subtropical and temperate wetlands (45° N-20° N and 30° S-50° S) were relatively low at 5 Tg/yr, the process-oriented focus of most of the research in this region suggests that work at these latitudes may serve as models to examine controls and possible uncertainties in estimating fluxes. These types of efforts are frequently not possible in more remote, globally significant wetlands. Northern wetlands (north of 45° N) were calculated to release a total of 38 TgCH4/yr (34{\%} of total flux); 34 Tg/yr from wet soils and 4 Tg/yr from relatively dry tundra. These latitudes have been the focus of recent intensive research. Significant differences between the relatively large flux data bases accumulated in the two primary measurement areas, northern Minnesota and the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Canada, indicate that extrapolation from one wetland region to another may be subject to considerable error. Global emissions were also compared to fluxes calculated using the wetland areas published by Aselmann and Crutzen (1989) in an effort to assess uncertainties due to wetland area estimates. Further refinement of wetland CH4 emissions awaits flux measurements from large areas currently lacking data, particularly in the tropics and the Siberian Lowlands, more realistic assessments of seasonal active periods, and accurate, up-to-date habitat classification and measurement.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel scale- and rotation-invariant interest point detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features). It approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper presents experimental results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery obtained in the context of a real-life object recognition application. Both show SURF's strong performance.},

abstract = {Anisotropy and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity (K) are suspected of greatly affecting rates and patterns of ground-water seepage in peats. A new laboratory method, termed here the modified cube method, was used to measure horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity (K(h) and K(v)) of 400 samples of bog peat. The new method avoids many of the problems associated with existing field and laboratory methods, and is shown to give relatively precise measurements of K. In the majority of samples tested, K(h) was much greater than K(v), indicating that the bog peat was strongly anisotropic. Log(10)K(h), log(10)K(v), and log(10) (K(h)/K(v)) were found to vary significantly with depth, although none of the relationships was simple. We comment on the scale dependency of our measurements.

@article{Beer2007,
abstract = {Rates of anaerobic respiration are of central importance for the long-term burial of carbon (C) in peatlands, which are a relevant sink in the global C cycle. To identify constraints on anaerobic peat decomposition, we determined detailed concentration depth profiles of decomposition end-products, i.e. methane (CH4) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), along with concentrations of relevant decomposition intermediates at an ombrotrophic Canadian peat bog. The magnitude of in situ net production rates of DIC and CH4 was estimated by inverse pore-water modeling. Vertical transport in the peat was slow and dominated by diffusion leading to the buildup of DIC and CH4 with depth (5500$\mu$molL−1 DIC, 500$\mu$molL−1 CH4). Highest DIC and CH4 production rates occurred close to the water table (decomposition constant kd∼10−3–10−4a−1) or in some distinct zones at depth (kd∼10−4a−1). Deeper into the peat, decomposition proceeded very slowly at about kd=10−7a−1. This pattern could be related to thermodynamic and transport constraints. The accumulation of metabolic end-products diminished in situ energy yields of acetoclastic methanogenesis to the threshold for microbially mediated processes (−20 to −25kJmol−1 CH4). The methanogenic precursor acetate also accumulated (150$\mu$molL−1). In line with these findings, CH4 was formed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at Gibbs free energies of −35 to −40kJ mol−1 CH4. This was indicated by an isotopic fractionation $\alpha$CO2–CH4 of 1.069–1.079. Fermentative degradation of acetate, propionate and butyrate attained Gibbs free energies close to 0kJmol−1 substrate. Although methanogenesis was apparently limited by some other factor in some peat layers, transport and thermodynamic constraints likely impeded respiratory processes in the deeper peat. Constraints on the removal of DIC and CH4 may thus slow decomposition and contribute to the sustained burial of C in northern peatlands.},

abstract = {Recent research in seismically active areas indicated that the spatial distributions of geochemical soil gas anomalies and nests of red wood ants (RWA; Formica rufa-group) are strongly correlated. Here we applied a modified Hough Transform (mHT) and an Iterative Mode Detection (IMD) to RWA nest positions, which we mapped in two Southwest German study areas (Black Forest and Bodanr{\"{u}}ck), to test for statistical significance of correlation with tectonic features. RWA densities in the seismically active study areas reaching up to 1600 nests/100ha are about 100× higher than overall values for Northern and Southern Germany. Since the shape of edges of the study area was found to strongly influence the selection of distribution patterns, all subsequent analyses were carried out for circular study areas. Results of the mHT applied on the RWA nests in both study areas clearly showed several modes which correspond to preferred directions. Centres of the modes further processed by IMD transferred into a GIS as RWA prototype lines showed very dominant directions of RWA nest distributions in right lateral strike-slip mode in WNW-ESE resp. NW-SE direction but also in extension direction caused by the recent main stress field in NW-SE resp. NNW-SSE direction. It could thus be clearly shown that the large scale spatial distribution of RWA nests directly reflects significant components of the present day stress field and its accompanying conjugated shear systems: Linear alignments of RWA nests indicate the course of active degassing faults zones and nest clusters indicate area-wide geochemical anomalies respectively crosscut zones of different fault systems. Furthermore, directions of re-activated shear systems, e.g. from Eocene-Oligocene but also from Late Jurassic that had been modified by overprinting due to changes of the main stress field could be identified. Therefore, RWA prototype lines complement and clarify the shear sense and the tectonic regime identified in previous tectonic studies. The high degree of statistical significance of these results will also allow a rating with former contrasting interpretations as to the drivers of RWA distributions.},

abstract = {In mountain areas, land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in the surface energy budget and is controlled by a complex interplay of topography, incoming radiation and atmospheric processes, as well as soil moisture distribution, different land covers and vegetation types. In this contribution, the LST spatial distribution of the Stubai Valley in the Austrian Alps is simulated by the ecohydrological model GEOtop. This simulation is compared with ground observations and a Landsat image in order to assess the capacity of the model to represent land surface interactions in complex terrain, as well as to evaluate the relative importance of different environmental factors. The model describes the energy and mass exchanges between soil, vegetation and atmosphere. It takes account of land cover, soil moisture and the implications of topography on air temperature and solar radiation. The GEOtop model is able to reproduce the spatial patterns of the LST distribution estimated from remote sensing, with a correlation coefficient of 0.88 and minimal calibration of the model parameters. Results show that, for the humid climate considered in this study, the major factors controlling LST spatial distribution are incoming solar radiation and land cover variability. Along mountain ridges and south-exposed steep slopes, soil moisture distribution has only a minor effect on LST. North- and south-facing slopes reveal a distinct thermal behaviour. In fact, LST appears to follow the air temperature vertical gradient along north-facing slopes, while along south-facing slopes, the LST vertical gradient is strongly modified by land cover type. Both Landsat observations and model simulations confirm field evidence of strong warming of alpine low vegetation during sunny days and indicate that these effects have an impact at a regional scale. Our results indicate that in order to simulate LST in mountain environments using a spatially distributed hydrological model, a key factor is the capacity to explicitly simulate the effects of complex topography on the surface energy exchange processes.

Quick response flow is predicted from a storage/contributing area relationship derived analytically from the topographic structure of a unit within a basin. Average soil water response is represented by a constant leakage infiltration store and an exponential subsurface water store. A simple non-linear routing procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the channel network completes the model and allows distinct basin sub-units, such as headwater and sideslope areas to be modelled separately. The model parameters are physically based in the sense that they may be determined directly by measurement and the model may be used at ungauged sites.

abstract = {Soil respiration, R(S), the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux(1-3). However, the dynamics of R(S) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained(4,5). Ecosystem warming experiments(6,7), modelling analyses(8,9) and fundamental biokinetics(10) all suggest that R(S) should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R(S), inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R(S) on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R(S) values in the extant four-decade record of R(S) chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R(S) observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R(S) record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO(2) measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R(S). We estimate that the global R(S) in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R(S) response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R(S) value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

@article{Boothroyd2015,
abstract = {Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the most important contributors to carbon budgets in peatland systems. Many studies have investigated factors affecting DOC concentration in peatland systems, yet hillslope position has been thus far overlooked as a variable that could influence DOC cycling. This study investigates the importance of hillslope position with regard to DOC cycling. Two upland peat hillslopes were studied in the Peak District, UK, to determine what impact, if any, hillslope position had upon DOC concentration. Hillslope position was found to be a significant factor affecting variation in soil pore water DOC concentration, with bottom-slope positions having significantly lower DOC concentrations than up-slope because of dilution of DOC as water moves down-slope and is flushed out of the system via lateral throughflow. Water table drawdown on steeper mid-slopes increased DOC concentrations through increased DOC production and extended residence times allowing a build-up of humic-rich DOC compounds. Hillslope position did not significantly affect DOC concentrations in surface runoff water because of the dilution of near-surface soil pore water by precipitation inputs, while stream water had similar water chemistry properties to soil pore water under low-flow conditions.},

@article{Bubier2006,
abstract = {Carbon (C) modeling and carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements in peatlands are dependent on the distribution and productivity of vegetation in a system with a high degree of spatial variability, often linked to the position of the water table. We tested the hypothesis that at a fine-scale (tens of metres) water table position exerts a strong control on species abundance, plant biomass, particularly photosynthetically active tissues, leaf area index (LAI), and areal foliar N and chlorophyll at Mer Bleue, a cool temperate peatland in eastern Canada. Total aboveground biomass ranged from 147 to 1011 g center dot m(-2), with shrubs contributing between 42{\%} and 72{\%} of the total in the transects. We found significant (P {\textless} 0.05) positive relationships between foliar and total vascular plant biomass and mean water table position, and significant decreases in the shrub foliar:woody biomass ratio and moss biomass with a lower water table. However, there was no significant relationship between water table position and photosynthetically active tissues (vascular plant leaves and moss capitulum), ranging from 114 to 672 g center dot m(-2)) and the areal mass of N in these tissues, ranging from 1.5 to 6.7 g center dot m(-2). Multivariate analyses of vegetation and environmental data showed that species distribution could be explained by both water table and chemistry gradients and that unimodal rather than linear responses best described the species and water table relationships. LAI ranged from 0.1 to over 3 and was correlated with both water table position and with vascular foliar biomass. Percent cover of shrubs was correlated with foliar biomass and LAI. Our results suggest that the less labour-intensive estimates of percent cover can be used to predict the vascular plant foliar biomass and LAI measurements. The lack of relationship between photosynthetically active tissues, tissue N concentrations, and water table may also explain the surprising lack of spatial variability in peak growing season eddy flux net ecosystem CO2 exchange in three different areas of the peatland.},

abstract = {Field hydrology is on the decline. Meanwhile, the need for new field-derived insight into the age, origin and pathway of water in the headwaters, where most runoff is generated, is more needed than ever. Water Resources Research (WRR) has included some of the most influential papers in field-based runoff process understanding, particularly in the formative years when the knowledge base was developing rapidly. Here, we take advantage of this 50th anniversary of the journal to highlight a few of these important field-based papers and show how field scientists have posed strong and sometimes outrageous hypotheses—approaches so needed in an era of largely model-only research. We chronicle the decline in field work and note that it is not only the quantity of field work that is diminishing but its character is changing too: from discovery science to data collection for model parameterisation. While the latter is a necessary activity, the loss of the former is a major concern if we are to advance the science of watershed hydrology. We outline a vision for field research to seek new fundamental understanding, new mechanistic explanations of how watershed systems work, particularly outside the regions of traditional focus.

@article{Campolongo2007,
abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified.},

Here we synthesize field data from arctic Alaska, showing that terrestrial changes in summer albedo contribute substantially to recent high-latitude warming trends. Pronounced terrestrial summer warming in arctic Alaska correlates with a lengthening of the snow-free season that has increased atmospheric heating locally by about 3 watts per square meter per decade (similar in magnitude to the regional heating expected over multiple decades from a doubling of atmospheric CO2). The continuation of current trends in shrub and tree expansion could further amplify this atmospheric heating by two to seven times.},

abstract = {Peatlands are a major terrestrial carbon store and a persistent natural carbon sink during the Holocene, but there is considerable uncertainty over the fate of peatland carbon in a changing climate. It is generally assumed that higher temperatures will increase peat decay, causing a positive feedback to climate warming and contributing to the global positive carbon cycle feedback. Here we use a new extensive database of peat profiles across northern high latitudes to examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation over the past millennium. Opposite to expectations, our results indicate a small negative carbon cycle feedback from past changes in the long-term accumulation rates of northern peatlands. Total carbon accumulated over the last 1000 yr is linearly related to contemporary growing season length and photosynthetically active radiation, suggesting that variability in net primary productivity is more important than decomposition in determining long-term carbon accumulation. Furthermore, northern peatland carbon sequestration rate declined over the climate transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA), probably because of lower LIA temperatures combined with increased cloudiness suppressing net primary productivity. Other factors including changing moisture status, peatland distribution, fire, nitrogen deposition, permafrost thaw and methane emissions will also influence future peatland carbon cycle feedbacks, but our data suggest that the carbon sequestration rate could increase over many areas of northern peatlands in a warmer future.},

The aims of this paper were to pre- sent reliable measurements of CO2 fluxes of a temperate bog ecosystem located in Poland using a closed dynamic chamber system and to obtain a daily dynamic course of CO2 fluxes over the 2007 vegetation sea- son. Measurements of CO2 fluxes were carried out at Rzecin peatland ecosystem located in northwestern Poland using the set of two chambers (dark and transparent). Reco during the experiment period ranged from 2.65 to 14.76 µmolCO2{\textperiodcentered}m-2 {\textperiodcentered}s-1 . The daily run of NEE was inversed to PPFD and the values of NEE varied from 0.06 to -11.82 µmolCO2{\textperiodcentered}m-2 {\textperiodcentered}s-1 . We found differences between NEE and Reco in the wetland ecosystem with respect to term of measurements. The PPFD, air and soil temperatures explain most temporal variability of CO2 fluxes at Rzecin. But vegetation structure, its phenology and water-level depth seem also to play impor- tant roles. The chamber technique is a useful tool for determining carbon dioxide exchange between wetland surface and the atmosphere. Keywords:},

abstract = {Future climate warming is expected to enhance plant growth in temperate ecosystems and to increase carbon sequestration. But although severe regional heatwaves may become more frequent in a changing climate, their impact on terrestrial carbon cycling is unclear. Here we report measurements of ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes, remotely sensed radiation absorbed by plants, and country-level crop yields taken during the European heatwave in 2003. We use a terrestrial biosphere simulation model to assess continental-scale changes in primary productivity during 2003, and their consequences for the net carbon balance. We estimate a 30 per cent reduction in gross primary productivity over Europe, which resulted in a strong anomalous net source of carbon dioxide (0.5 Pg C yr(-1)) to the atmosphere and reversed the effect of four years of net ecosystem carbon sequestration. Our results suggest that productivity reduction in eastern and western Europe can be explained by rainfall deficit and extreme summer heat, respectively. We also find that ecosystem respiration decreased together with gross primary productivity, rather than accelerating with the temperature rise. Model results, corroborated by historical records of crop yields, suggest that such a reduction in Europe's primary productivity is unprecedented during the last century. An increase in future drought events could turn temperate ecosystems into carbon sources, contributing to positive carbon-climate feedbacks already anticipated in the tropics and at high latitudes.},

abstract = {Whether climate change will turn cold biomes from large long-term carbon sinks into sources is hotly debated because of the great potential for ecosystem-mediated feedbacks to global climate. Critical are the direction, magnitude and generality of climate responses of plant litter decomposition. Here, we present the first quantitative analysis of the major climate-change-related drivers of litter decomposition rates in cold northern biomes worldwide. Leaf litters collected from the predominant species in 33 global change manipulation experiments in circum-arctic-alpine ecosystems were incubated simultaneously in two contrasting arctic life zones. We demonstrate that longer-term, large-scale changes to leaf litter decomposition will be driven primarily by both direct warming effects and concomitant shifts in plant growth form composition, with a much smaller role for changes in litter quality within species. Specifically, the ongoing warming-induced expansion of shrubs with recalcitrant leaf litter across cold biomes would constitute a negative feedback to global warming. Depending on the strength of other (previously reported) positive feedbacks of shrub expansion on soil carbon turnover, this may partly counteract direct warming enhancement of litter decomposition.},

abstract = {The lowland peatlands of south-east Asia represent an immense reservoir of fossil carbon and are reportedly responsible for 30{\%} of the global carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry. This paper provides a review and meta-analysis of available literature on greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical peat soils in south-east Asia. As in other parts of the world, water level is the main control on greenhouse gas fluxes from south-east Asian peat soils. Based on subsidence data we calculate emissions of at least 900 g CO(2) m-2 a-1 (similar to 250 g C m-2 a-1) for each 10 cm of additional drainage depth. This is a conservative estimate as the role of oxidation in subsidence and the increased bulk density of the uppermost drained peat layers are yet insufficiently quantified. The majority of published CO(2) flux measurements from south-east Asian peat soils concerns undifferentiated respiration at floor level, providing inadequate insight on the peat carbon balance. In contrast to previous assumptions, regular peat oxidation after drainage might contribute more to the regional long-term annual CO(2) emissions than peat fires. Methane fluxes are negligible at low water levels and amount to up to 3 mg CH(4) m-2 h-1 at high water levels, which is low compared with emissions from boreal and temperate peatlands. The latter emissions may be exceeded by fluxes from rice paddies on tropical peat soil, however. N(2)O fluxes are erratic with extremely high values upon application of fertilizer to wet peat soils. Current data on CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes indicate that peatland rewetting in south-east Asia will lead to substantial reductions of net greenhouse gas emissions. There is, however, an urgent need for further quantitative research on carbon exchange to support the development of consistent policies for climate change mitigation.},

abstract = {Stream and river carbon dioxide emissions are an important component of the global carbon cycle. Methane emissions from streams could also contribute to regional or global greenhouse gas cycling, but there are relatively few data regarding stream and river methane emissions. Furthermore, the available data do not typically include the ebullitive (bubble-mediated) pathway, instead focusing on emission of dissolved methane by diffusion or convection. Here, we show the importance of ebullitive methane emissions from small streams in the regional greenhouse gas balance of a lake and wetland-dominated landscape in temperate North America and identify the origin of the methane emitted from these well-oxygenated streams. Stream methane flux densities from this landscape tended to exceed those of nearby wetland diffusive fluxes as well as average global wetland ebullitive fluxes. Total stream ebullitive methane flux at the regional scale (103 Mg C yr(-1) ; over 6400 km(2) ) was of the same magnitude as diffusive methane flux previously documented at the same scale. Organic-rich stream sediments had the highest rates of bubble release and higher enrichment of methane in bubbles, but glacial sand sediments also exhibited high bubble emissions relative to other studied environments. Our results from a database of groundwater chemistry support the hypothesis that methane in bubbles is produced in anoxic near-stream sediment porewaters, and not in deeper, oxygenated groundwaters. Methane interacts with other key elemental cycles such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, which has implications for ecosystem changes such as drought and increased nutrient loading. Our results support the contention that streams, particularly those draining wetland landscapes of the northern hemisphere, are an important component of the global methane cycle.},

abstract = {Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils--including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost--than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.},

The study aims to estimate crown defoliation in 2030, under three climate and one nitrogen deposition scenarios, based on evaluation of the most important factors (meteorological, nitrogen deposition and chemical soil parameters) affecting defoliation of twelve European tree species. The combination of favourable climate and nitrogen fertilization in the more adaptive species induces a generalized decrease of defoliation. On the other hand, severe climate change and drought are main causes of increase in defoliation in Quercus ilex and Fagus sylvatica, especially in Mediterranean area. Our results provide information on regional distribution of future defoliation, an important knowledge for identifying policies to counteract negative impacts of climate change and air pollution.},

abstract = {The effects of elevation on surface water fluxes in dry alpine grassland ecosystems were investigated along an elevational transect between 1,000 and 2,000 m a.s.l. established in the Vinschgau/Venosta valley, a relatively dry region in the Italian Alps. The GEOtop-dv hydrological model was employed in point-scale mode to model the effects of the elevation gradient on snow water equivalent (SWE), soil water content ($\theta$) evapotranspiration (ET), above ground biomass (Bag) and water use efficiency (WUE) in different climatic conditions. Results show that SWE decreased strongly with decreasing elevation, but was also affected by the interannual variability of meteorological drivers. During warmer years the magnitude of changes in SWE was mitigated at higher altitudes, while exacerbated below 1,500 m. $\theta$ dynamics indicated that water stress conditions for vegetation currently occur at 1,000 m each year, while only a warmer and drier year caused drought at 1,500 m and no water stress was found at 2,000 m.ET, Bag and WUE did not decrease with elevation, but showed a maximum at an intermediate elevation around ca. 1,500 m, because of the contrasting trends of a shorter vegetation season at higher elevations and water stress at lower elevations, where, in fact, irrigation is needed to maintain grassland productivity. A simulation based on long-term climatic conditions in combination with a sensitivity analysis of precipitation change showed that this effect is more pronounced during drier years, while for the wettest years ET tended to decrease with increasing elevation. Taking these findings together, this study suggests that in relatively dry climatic conditions, mountain areas generally act as “water towers” above 1,500 m. Quantifying this critical threshold and its likely future variation under climate change scenarios is a challenge for water resource research in the Alpine region and can help stakeholders in planning future mitigation strategies.

abstract = {Since the advancement in CH4 gas analyser technology and its applicability to eddy covariance flux measurements, monitoring of CH4 emissions is becoming more widespread. In order to accurately determine the greenhouse gas balance, high quality gap-free data is required. Currently there is still no consensus on CH4 gap-filling methods, and methods applied are still study-dependent and often carried out on low resolution, daily data. In the current study, we applied artificial neural networks to six distinctively different CH4 time series from high latitudes, explain the method and test its functionality. We discuss the applicability of neural networks in CH4 flux studies, the advantages and disadvantages of this method, and what information we were able to extract from such models. Three different approaches were tested by including drivers such as air and soil temperature, barometric air pressure, solar radiation, wind direction (indicator of source location) and in addition the lagged effect of water table depth and precipitation. In keeping with the principle of parsimony, we included up to five of these variables traditionally measured at CH4 flux measurement sites. Fuzzy sets were included representing the seasonal change and time of day. High Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of up to 0.97 achieved in the final analysis are indicative for the high performance of neural networks and their applicability as a gap-filling method for CH4 flux data time series. This novel approach which we show to be appropriate for CH4 fluxes is a step towards standardising CH4 gap-filling protocols.},

abstract = {Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

abstract = {Among the largest uncertainties in current projections of future climate is the feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate(1). Northern peatlands contain one-third of the world's soil organic carbon, equivalent to more than half the amount of carbon in the atmosphere(2). Climate-warming-induced acceleration of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions through enhanced respiration of thick peat deposits, centuries to millennia old, may form a strong positive carbon cycle-climate feedback. The long-term temperature sensitivity of carbon in peatlands, especially at depth, remains uncertain, however, because of the short duration or correlative nature of field studies(3-5) and the disturbance associated with respiration measurements below the surface in situ or during laboratory incubations(6,7). Here we combine non-disturbing in situ measurements of CO(2) respiration rates and isotopic ((13)C) composition of respired CO(2) in two whole-ecosystem climate-manipulation experiments in a subarctic peatland. We show that approximately 1 degrees C warming accelerated total ecosystem respiration rates on average by 60{\%} in spring and by 52{\%} in summer and that this effect was sustained for at least eight years. While warming stimulated both short-term (plant-related) and longer-term (peat soil-related) carbon respiration processes, we find that at least 69{\%} of the increase in respiration rate originated from carbon in peat towards the bottom (25-50 cm) of the active layer above the permafrost. Climate warming therefore accelerates respiration of the extensive, subsurface carbon reservoirs in peatlands to a much larger extent than was previously thought(6,7). Assuming that our data from a single site are indicative of the direct response to warming of northern peatland soils on a global scale, we estimate that climate warming of about 1 degrees C over the next few decades could induce a global increase in heterotrophic respiration of 38-100 megatonnes of C per year. Our findings suggest a large, long-lasting, positive feedback of carbon stored in northern peatlands to the global climate system.},

abstract = {Northern peatlands cover approximately 4{\%} of the global land surface area. Those peatlands will be particularly vulnerable to environmental and climate change and therefore it is important to investigate their total greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, to determine the feedback on the climate. Nitrogen (N) is known to influence the GHG budget in particular by affecting the methane (CH4) balance. At two peatland sites in Scotland and Finland GHG fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen fluxes were measured as part of the European project ‘NitroEurope'. The Scottish site, Auchencorth Moss, was a GHG sink of −321, −490 and −321 g CO2 eq m−2 year−1 in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, with CO2 as the dominating GHG. In contrast, the dominating GHG at the Finnish site, Lompolojnkk, was CH4, resulting in the site being a net GHG source of +485 and +431 g CO2 eq m−2 year−1 in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Therefore, Auchencorth Moss had a negative global warming potential (GWP) whilst Lompolojnkk had a positive GWP over the investigated time period. Initial results yielded a positive N budget for Lompolojnkk of 7.1 kg N ha−1 year−1, meaning the site was gaining nitrogen, and a negative N budget for Auchencorth Moss of −2.4 kg N ha year−1, meaning the site was losing nitrogen},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A meta-analysis of global change experiments in arctic tundra sites suggests that plant productivity and the cover of shrubs, grasses and dead plant material (i.e. litter) will increase and the cover of bryophytes will decrease in response to higher air temperatures. However, little is known about which effects these changes in vegetation structure will have on seedling recruitment of species and invasibility of arctic ecosystems.

METHODS: A field experiment was done in a bryophyte-dominated, species-rich subarctic heath by manipulating the cover of bryophytes and litter in a factorial design. Three phases of seedling recruitment (seedling emergence, summer seedling survival, first-year recruitment) of the grass Anthoxanthum alpinum and the shrub Betula nana were analysed after they were sown into the experimental plots.

KEY RESULTS: Bryophyte and litter removal significantly increased seedling emergence of both species but the effects of manipulations of vegetation structure varied strongly for the later phases of recruitment. Summer survival and first-year recruitment were significantly higher in Anthoxanthum. Although bryophyte removal generally increased summer survival and recruitment, seedlings of Betula showed high mortality in early August on plots where bryophytes had been removed.

CONCLUSIONS: Large species-specific variation and significant effects of experimental manipulations on seedling recruitment suggest that changes in vegetation structure as a consequence of global warming will affect the abundance of grasses and shrubs, the species composition and the susceptibility to invasion of subarctic heath vegetation.},

abstract = {High Arctic landscapes are expansive and changing rapidly. However our understanding of their functional responses and potential to mitigate or enhance anthropogenic climate change is limited by few measurements. We collected eddy covariance measurements to quantify the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 with polar semidesert and meadow wetland landscapes at the highest-latitude location measured to date (82°N). We coupled these rare data with ground and satellite vegetation production measurements (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI) to evaluate the effectiveness of upscaling local to regional NEE. During the growing season, the dry polar semidesert landscape was a near zero sink of atmospheric CO2 (NEE: -0.3±13.5 g C m(-2) ). A nearby meadow wetland accumulated over 300 times more carbon (NEE: -79.3±20.0 g C m(-2) ) than the polar semidesert landscape, and was similar to meadow wetland NEE at much more southerly latitudes. Polar semidesert NEE was most influenced by moisture, with wetter surface soils resulting in greater soil respiration and CO2 emissions. At the meadow wetland, soil heating enhanced plant growth, which in turn increased CO2 uptake. Our upscaling assessment found that polar semidesert NDVI measured on site was low (mean: 0.120-0.157) and similar to satellite measurements (mean: 0.155-0.163). However, weak plant growth resulted in poor satellite NDVI-NEE relationships and created challenges for remotely-detecting changes in the cycling of carbon on the polar semidesert landscape. The meadow wetland appeared more suitable to assess plant production and NEE via remote-sensing, however high Arctic wetland extent is constrained by topography to small areas that may be difficult to resolve with large satellite pixels. We predict that until summer precipitation and humidity increases substantially, climate-related changes of dry high Arctic landscapes may be restricted by poor soil moisture retention, and therefore have some inertia against short-term changes in NEE.

Furthermore, it reproduces the highly non-linear interactions between the water and energy balance during soil freezing and thawing, and simulates the temporal evolution of the water and energy budgets in the snow cover and their effect on soil temperature. Here, we present the core components of GEOtop 2.0 and demonstrate its functioning. Based on a synthetic simulation, we show that the interaction of processes represented in GEOtop 2.0 can result in phenomena that are significant and relevant for applications involving permafrost and seasonally frozen soils, both in high altitude and latitude regions.},

abstract = {Assessing potential future changes in arctic and boreal plant species productivity, ecosystem composition, and canopy complexity is essential for understanding environmental responses under expected altered climate forcing. We examined potential changes in the dominant plant functional types (PFTs) of the sedge tundra, shrub tundra, and boreal forest ecosystems in ecotonal northern Alaska, USA, for the years 2003-2100. We compared energy feedbacks associated with increases in biomass to energy feedbacks associated with changes in the duration of the snow-free season. We based our simulations on nine input climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a new version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) that incorporates biogeochemistry, vegetation dynamics for multiple PFTs (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses, sedges, mosses), multiple vegetation pools, and soil thermal regimes. We found mean increases in net primary productivity (NPP) in all PFTs. Most notably, birch (Betula spp.) in the shrub tundra showed increases that were at least three times larger than any other PFT. Increases in NPP were positively related to increases in growing-season length in the sedge tundra, but PFTs in boreal forest and shrub tundra showed a significant response to changes in light availability as well as growing-season length. Significant NPP responses to changes in vegetation uptake of nitrogen by PFT indicated that some PFTs were better competitors for nitrogen than other PFTs. While NPP increased, heterotrophic respiration (RH) also increased, resulting in decreases or no change in net ecosystem carbon uptake. Greater aboveground biomass from increased NPP produced a decrease in summer albedo, greater regional heat absorption (0.34 +/- 0.23 W x m(-2) x 10 yr(-1) [mean +/- SD]), and a positive feedback to climate warming. However, the decrease in albedo due to a shorter snow season (-5.1 +/- 1.6 d/10 yr) resulted in much greater regional heat absorption (3.3 +/- 1.24 W x m(-2) x 10 yr(-1)) than that associated with increases in vegetation. Through quantifying feedbacks associated with changes in vegetation and those associated with changes in the snow season length, we can reach a more integrated understanding of the manner in which climate change may impact interactions between high-latitude ecosystems and the climate system.},

abstract = {Physically based spatially distributed (PBSD) river basin models have been available for over 10 years. One of their strengths lies in the way the surface and subsurface are represented as coupled parts of a whole, giving ground-water flows that are controlled by such factors as realistic surface saturation and infiltration, and surface conditions that are controlled by realistic groundwater levels, discharges, and so forth. PBSD sediment and solute transport models can be integrated into PBSD river basin modeling systems, and the integrated systems are powerful tools for studying the environmental impacts associated with land erosion, pollution, and the effects of changes in land use and climate, and also in studying surface-water and ground-water resources and their management. SHETRAN takes PBSD river basin modeling a step further, in that multifraction sediment transport and multiple, reactive solute transport are handled within a single system, fully coupled to water flow, and the subsurface is modeled as a fully 3D variably saturated heterogeneous medium. SHETRAN therefore has a substantial capability for addressing environmental and water resources problems that span the traditional disciplines of river basin and ground-water modeling.},

abstract = {Land application of biosolids from processed sewage sludge may deteriorate soil, water, and plants. We investigated the impact of the N-Viro biosolids land-application on the quality of the soil water that moved through Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzols soil of Nova Scotia (NS) at the Wild Blueberry Research Institute, Debert, NS Canada. In addition, the response of major soilproperties and crop yield was also studied. Wild blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium. Ait) was grown under irrigated and rainfed conditions in 2008 and 2009. Four experimental treatments including (i) NI: N-Viro irrigated, (ii) NR: N-Viro rainfed, (iii) FI: inorganic fertilizer irrigated, and (iv) FR: inorganic fertilizer rainfed (control) were replicated 4 times under randomized complete block design. Soil samples were collected at the end of each year and analyzed for changes in cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic matter (SOM), and pH.Soil water samples were collected four times during the study period from the suction cup lysimeters installed within and below crop root zone at 20 and 40 cm depths, respectively. The samples were analyzed for a range of water quality parameters including conductance, hardness, pH, macro- and micronutrients, and the infectious pathogens Escherichia coli (E. coli) and salmonella. Berries were harvested for fruit yield estimates. Irrigation significantly increased CEC during 2008 and the soil pH decreased from 4.93 (2008) to 4.79 (2009). There were significant influences of irrigation, fertilizer, and their interaction, in some cases, on most of the soil water quality parameters except on the infectious bacteria. No presence of E. coli or salmonella were observed in soil and water samples, reflecting the absence of these bacteria in biosolids used in this experiment. Nutrient concentration in the soil water samples collected from the four treatments were higher in the sequence NI {\textgreater} NR {\textgreater} FI {\textgreater} FR. The irrigation treatment had significant effect on the unripe fruit yield. We conclude that the comparable performance of N-Viro biosolids and the increasing prices of inorganic fertilizers would compel farmers to use economically available N-Viro biosolids that, coupled with the supplemental irrigation, did not deteriorate the studied soil properties, soil water quality, and the wild blueberry yield during this experiment.},

abstract = {Dense stands of birch (Betula spp.) on abandoned peat workings have often been identified as potential barriers to site restoration, but little research has been conducted to evaluate their impact on water resources. The objective of this experimental study was to determine whether birch seedlings established on an abandoned mined peatland in eastern Canada had a significant impact on evapotranspiration. Transpiration rates from birch seedlings planted in containers filled with Sphagnum compost were measured gravimetrically. Unplanted containers were used to similarly measure evaporation rates from bare peat. On average, the measured rates of evaporation (per unit area) from peat were 2.5 times the rates of transpiration from birch leaves. However, if the total leaf area of a dense birch population established on an abandoned mined peatland is considered, the total amount of water lost through birch transpiration could be higher than that lost by evaporation from the peat surface. This study provides a rough estimate of potential water losses due to birch seedling transpiration, and indicates that a dense population of birch on a mined peatland may influence site hydrology even at the early establishment phase (seedlings). Consequently, recently abandoned mined peatlands should be restored rapidly to prevent the establishment of birch trees.},

abstract = {This paper presents a discussion of the predictive capacity of the implementation of the semi-distributed hydrological modeling system JGrass-NewAge. This model focuses on the hydrological budgets of medium scale to large scale basins as the product of the processes at the hillslope scale with the interplay of the river network. The part of the modeling system presented here deals with the: (i) estimation of the space-time structure of precipitation, (ii) estimation of runoff production; (iii) aggregation and propagation of flows in channel; (v) estimation of evapotranspiration; (vi) automatic calibration of the discharge with the method of particle swarming. The system is based on a hillslope-link geometrical partition of the landscape, combining raster and vectorial treatment of hillslope data with vector based tracking of flow in channels. Measured precipitation are spatially interpolated with the use of kriging. Runoff production at each channel link is estimated through a peculiar application of the Hymod model. Routing in channels uses an integrated flow equation and produces discharges at any link end, for any link in the river network. Evapotranspiration is estimated with an implementation of the Priestley-Taylor equation. The model system assembly is calibrated using the particle swarming algorithm. A two year simulation of hourly discharge of the Little Washita (OK, USA) basin is presented and discussed with the support of some classical indices of goodness of fit, and analysis of the residuals. A novelty with respect to traditional hydrological modeling is that each of the elements above, including the preprocessing and the analysis tools, is implemented as a software component, built upon Object Modelling System v3 and jgrasstools prescriptions, that can be cleanly switched in and out at run-time, rather than at compiling time. The possibility of creating different modeling products by the connection of modules with or without the calibration tool, as for instance the case of the present modeling chain, reduces redundancy in programming, promotes collaborative work, enhances the productivity of researchers, and facilitates the search for the optimal modeling solution.},

abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and irradiance (as photosynthetic photon flux density or PPFD), using published and unpublished data that have been collected during midgrowing season for carbon balance studies at seven peatlands in North America and Europe, NEE measurements included both eddy-correlation tower and clear, static chamber methods, which gave very similar results. Data were analyzed by site, as aggregated data sets by peatland type (bog, poor fen, rich fen, and all fens) and as a single aggregated data set for all peatlands. In all cases, a fit with a rectangular hyperbola (NEE = alpha PPFD P(sub max)/(alpha PPFD + P(sub max) + R) better described the NEE-PPFD relationship than did a linear fit (NEE = beta PPFD + R). Poor and rich fens generally had similar NEE-PPFD relationships, while bogs had lower respiration rates (R = -2.0 micro mol m(exp -2) s(exp -1) for bogs and -2.7 micro mol m(exp -2) s(exp -1)) for fens) and lower NEE at moderate and high light levels (P(sub max)= 5.2 micro mol m(exp -2) s(exp -1) for bogs and 10.8 micro mol m(exp -2) s(exp -1) for fens). As a single class, northern peatlands had much smaller ecosystem respiration (R = -2.4 micro mol m(exp -2) s(exp -1)) and NEE rates (alpha = 0.020 and P(sub max)= 9.2 micro mol m(exp -2) s(exp -1)) than the upland ecosystems (closed canopy forest, grassland, and cropland). Despite this low productivity, northern peatland soil carbon pools are generally 5-50 times larger than upland ecosystems because of slow rates of decomposition caused by litter quality and anaerobic, cold soils.},

abstract = {Northern peatlands sequester carbon and emit methane, and thus have both cooling and warming impacts on the climate system through their influence on atmospheric burdens of CO2 and CH4. These competing impacts are usually compared by the global warming potential (GWP) methodology, which determines the equivalent CO2 annual emission that would have the same integrated radiative forcing impact over a chosen time horizon as the annual CH4 emission. We use a simple model of CH4 and CO2 pools in the atmosphere to extend this analysis to quantify the dynamics, over years to millennia, of the net radiative forcing impact of a peatland that continuously emits CH4 and sequesters C. We find that for observed ratios of CH4 emission to C sequestration (roughly 0.1–2 mol mol-1), the radiative forcing impact of a northern peatland begins, at peatland formation, as a net warming that peaks after about 50 years, remains a diminishing net warming for the next several hundred to several thousand years, depending on the rate of C sequestration, and thereafter is or will be an ever increasing net cooling impact. We then use the model to evaluate the radiative forcing impact of various changes in CH4 and/or CO2 emissions. In all cases, the impact of a change in CH4 emissions dominates the radiative forcing impact in the first few decades, and then the impact of the change in CO2 emissions slowly exerts its influence.},

abstract = {[1] Northern peatlands contain enormous quantities of organic carbon within a few meters of the atmosphere and play a significant role in the planetary carbon balance. We have developed a new, process-oriented model of the contemporary carbon balance of northern peatlands, the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS). Components of PCARS are (1) vascular and nonvascular plant photosynthesis and respiration, net aboveground and belowground production, and litterfall; (2) aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of peat; (3) production, oxidation, and emission of methane; and (4) dissolved organic carbon loss with drainage water. PCARS has an hourly time step and requires air and soil temperatures, incoming radiation, water table depth, and horizontal drainage as drivers. Simulations predict a complete peatland C balance for one season to several years. A 3-year simulation was conducted for Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, and results were compared with multiyear eddy covariance tower CO(2) flux and ancillary measurements from the site. Seasonal patterns and the general magnitude of net ecosystem exchange of CO(2) were similar for PCARS and the tower data, though PCARS was generally biased toward net ecosystem respiration (i.e., carbon loss). Gross photosynthesis rates (calculated directly in PCARS, empirically inferred from tower data) were in good accord, so the discrepancy between model and measurement was likely related to autotrophic and/or heterotrophic respiration. Modeled and measured methane emission rates were quite low. PCARS has been designed to link with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) land surface model and a global climate model (GCM) to examine climate-peatland carbon feedbacks at regional scales in future analyses.},

abstract = {Peatlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Earth's land area, but they are a globally important carbon store because of their high carbon density. Undisturbed peatlands are currently a weak carbon sink (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a moderate source of methane (CH(4); similar to 0.03 Pg CH(4) y(-1)), and a very weak source of nitrous oxide (N(2)O; similar to 0.00002 Pg N(2)O-N y(-1)). Anthropogenic disturbance, primarily agriculture and forestry drainage (10{\%}-20{\%} of global peatlands), results in net CO(2) emissions, reduced CH(4) emissions, and increased N(2)O emissions. This likely changes the global peatland greenhouse gas balance to a C source (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a 10{\%} smaller CH(4) source, and a larger (but still small) N(2)O source (similar to 0.0004 Pg N(2)O-N y(-1)). There is no strong evidence that peatlands significantly contributed to 20th century changes in the atmospheric burden of CO(2), CH(4), or N(2)O; will this picture change in the 21st century? A review of experimental and observational studies of peatland dynamics indicates that the main global change impacts on peatlands that may have significant climate impacts are (1) drainage, especially in the tropics; (2) widespread permafrost thaw; and (3) increased fire intensity and frequency as a result of drier climatic conditions and (or) drainage. Quantitative estimates of global change impacts are limited by the sparse field data (particularly in the tropics), the large variability present in existing data, uncertainties in the future trajectory of peatland use, interactive effects of individual impacts, and the unprecedented rates of climate change expected in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Each year, a peatland has an annual net carbon balance (NCB), which can be positive (net uptake), zero or negative. Over centuries to millennia, this NCB accumulates as a peat profile. Contemporary peatlands can be sampled (cored), and the past apparent carbon accumulation rate (aCAR) can be determined as the quantity of peat carbon in any particular dated interval down the core profile. We use a process-based peatland carbon and water cycle model to compare peatland annual NCB during millennia of peat accumulation to the contemporary estimate of aCAR, resulting from this accumulation. Integrating over the entire profile, the accumulated NCB must equal the aCAR, but for shorter time intervals, these two quantities can diverge. A climate variation/perturbation that leads to persistent, slow carbon loss or negligible carbon gain through enhanced decomposition will necessarily reduce the aCAR for time periods before the climate variation/perturbation occurred. This can compromise peatland climate-carbon balance relationships inferred from joint analysis of peat cores and paleoclimate reconstructions.},

abstract = {Wetlands are highly productive and support a wide variety of ecosystem goods and services. Various forms of global change impose compelling needs for timely and reliable information on the status of wetlands worldwide, but several characteristics of wetlands make them challenging to monitor remotely: they lack a single, unifying land-cover feature; they tend to be highly dynamic and their energy signatures are constantly changing; and steep environmental gradients in and around wetlands produce narrow ecotones that often are below the resolving capacity of remote sensors. These challenges and needs set the context for a special issue focused on wetland remote sensing. Contributed papers responded to one of three overarching questions aimed at improving remote, large-area monitoring of wetlands: (1) What approaches and data products are being developed specifically to support regional to global long-term monitoring of wetland landscapes? (2) What are the promising new technologies and sensor/multisensor approaches for more accurate and consistent detection of wetlands? (3) Are there studies that demonstrate how remote long-term monitoring of wetland landscapes can reveal changes that correspond with changes in land cover and land use and/or changes in climate?},

abstract = {Natural wetlands form the largest source of methane (CH(4)) to the atmosphere. Emission of this powerful greenhouse gas from wetlands is known to depend on climate, with increasing temperature and rainfall both expected to increase methane emissions. This study, combining our field and controlled environment manipulation studies in Europe and North America, reveals an additional control: an emergent pattern of increasing suppression of methane (CH(4)) emission from peatlands with increasing sulfate (SO(4)(2-)-S) deposition, within the range of global acid deposition. We apply a model of this relationship to demonstrate the potential effect of changes in global sulfate deposition from 1960 to 2080 on both northern peatland and global wetland CH(4) emissions. We estimate that sulfur pollution may currently counteract climate-induced growth in the wetland source, reducing CH(4) emissions by approximately 15 Tg or 8{\%} smaller than it would be in the absence of global acid deposition. Our findings suggest that by 2030 sulfur pollution may be sufficient to reduce CH(4) emissions by 26 Tg or 15{\%} of the total wetland source, a proportion as large as other components of the CH(4) budget that have until now received far greater attention. We conclude that documented increases in atmospheric CH(4) concentration since the late 19th century are likely due to factors other than the global warming of wetlands.},

abstract = {Peatlands are important sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) that, in response to climate warming, are undergoing dynamic vegetation succession. Here we examined the hypothesis that the uptake of nutrients by different plant growth forms (PGFs) is one key mechanism driving changes in species abundance in peatlands. Along an altitude gradient representing a natural climate experiment, we compared the variability of the stable C isotope composition ($\delta$(13)C) and stable nitrogen (N) isotope composition ($\delta$(15)N) in current-year leaves of two major PGFs, i.e. ericoids and graminoids. The climate gradient was associated with a gradient of vascular plant cover, which was parallelled by different concentrations of organic and inorganic N as well as the fungal/bacterial ratio in peat. In both PGFs the (13)C natural abundance showed a marginal spatial decrease with altitude and a temporal decrease with progression of the growing season. Our data highlight a primary physical control of foliar $\delta$(13)C signature, which is independent from the PGFs. Natural abundance of foliar (15)N did not show any seasonal pattern and only in the ericoids showed depletion at lower elevation. This decreasing $\delta$(15)N pattern was primarily controlled by the higher relative availability of organic versus inorganic N and, only for the ericoids, by an increased proportion of fungi to bacteria in soil. Our space-for-time approach demonstrates that a change in abundance of PGFs is associated with a different strategy of nutrient acquisition (i.e. transfer via mycorrhizal symbiosis versus direct fine-root uptake), which could likely promote observed and predicted dwarf shrub expansion under climate change.},

abstract = {Efforts to increase our understanding of the terrestrial carbon balance have resulted in a dense global network of eddy covariance towers, which are able to measure the net ecosystem exchange of CO2, H2O and energy between ecosystems and the atmosphere. However, the typical set-up on an eddy covariance tower does not monitor lateral CO2- and carbon fluxes such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). By ignoring DOC fluxes eddy covariance-based CO2 balances overestimate the carbon sink of ecosystems as part of the DOC drains into the inland waters and get respired outside the footprint of the eddy covariance tower. In this study we quantify 7 years (2000–2006) of DOC fluxes from a temperate Scots pine forest in Belgium and analyse its inter-annual variability. On average, 10gCm−2year−1 is leached from the pine forest as DOC. If the DOC fluxes are considered relative to the gross ecosystem carbon fluxes we see that DOC fluxes are small: 0.8±0.2{\%} relative to gross primary productivity, 1.0±0.3{\%} relative to ecosystem respiration, and (2.4±0.4{\%}) relative to soil respiration. However, when compared to net fluxes such as net ecosystem productivity and net biome productivity the DOC flux is no longer negligible (11±7{\%} and 17{\%}, respectively), especially because the DOC losses constitute a systematic bias and not a random error. The inter-annual variability of the DOC fluxes followed that of annual water drainage. Hence, drainage drives DOC leaching at both short and long time scales. Finally, it is noted that part of the carbon that is leached from the ecosystem as DOC is respired or sequestered elsewhere, so the physical boundaries of accounting should always be reported together with the carbon budget.},

The simulated temperature change signal shows a substantial elevation dependency, mostly during the winter and spring seasons, resulting in more pronounced warming at high elevations than low elevations. This is caused by a depletion of snowpack in doubled CO2 conditions and further enhanced by the snow–albedo feedback. This result is consistent with some observed temperature trends for anomalously warm years over the Alpine region and suggests that high elevation temperature changes could be used as an early detection tool for global warming. Changes in precipitation, as well as other components of the surface energy and water budgets, also show an elevation signal, which may have important implications for impact assessments in high elevation regions.},

abstract = {The hydraulic properties of fen peat soils from the Biebrza River Valley in the north-east of Poland were investigated. 87 soil samples were collected from nine typical peat-moorsh soil profiles representing three types of peat: moss with fibrous structure, herbaceous and wooden peat characterised by amorphous structure with high humus content. The multi-step outflow method was used to determine the parameters of the Mualem-van Genuchten model (MVG) that describes soil moisture retention characteristics and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function of each soil sample. The agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis of the parameters of MVG model was applied in order to obtain typical hydraulic functions for the three types of peat considered. As a result of the analysis, the hydraulic properties of the fen peat soils were agglomerated into five clusters. The MVG model parameters as well as hydraulic functions were analysed for distinguished clusters. The parameters of the moss peats with low degree of decomposition and fibric structure were different from those of the herbaceous and wooden decomposed peats with high humus content. The largest values of the hydraulically active pore space (difference between saturated and residual moisture content) were observed for moss peat samples, while the lowest values were observed for wooden peat samples. The empirical parameters describing the shape of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function Were depended on the type of the peat and therefore the degree of decomposition. The L parameter values of the herbaceous and wooden pears were generally greater than 0, whereas for the moss peat samples they were ranging from -5 to 5. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the herbaceous and wooden peat soils was close to that of very fine-textured mineral soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study predicted the spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the pristine peatlands throughout Finland during the 21st century based on 10 km x 10 km grids. The predictions are based on a regional carbon (C) model that emphasizes the mire-type differences in ecohydrology and biogeochemistry. The model was validated by field measurements performed at multiple sites in Finland. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the CO2 flux was more sensitive to changes in temperature than to changes in precipitation, and this temperature sensitivity is greater in fens than in bogs. Conversely, the CH4 emission from pristine fens is more sensitive to the changes in precipitation and temperature than pristine bogs. The spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes were calculated based on the country-scale patterns of mire properties (i.e., fen-bog types, vegetation, topography and peat texture) and the ACCLIM climate change scenarios. The results indicate a decreasing CO2 sinks in the country-scale peatlands, and such a decrease will be most noticeable from 2060 to 2099. In addition, the annual CO2 sink value and the annual CH4 source value of the peatlands will decrease significantly in the western areas of the raised bog region, and such changes will be greater in the pristine fens than in pristine bogs. A large fraction of the fens in the raised-bog region and the southwestern part of the aapa-mire region has the potential to shift from CO2 sinks into weak CO2 sources ({\textless}20 g C m(-2) a(-1)) by the end of the 21st century. The transition of bogs from centurial CO2 sinks to sources is most notable near coastal areas. These bogs would function as CO2 sources at an average rate of over 40 g Cm-2 a(-1) for the 21st century under the changing climate scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using Clymo's (1984) model, the current rate is estimated at 0.076 Pg/yr. Longterm drainage of these peatlands is estimated to be causing the oxidation to CO2 of a little more than 0.0085 Pg/yr, with conbustion of fuel peat adding °0.026 Pg/yr.

abstract = {About 2.4 Pg (1 Pg = 10(15) g) of carbon is emitted annually into the atmosphere as reactive compounds and most of it is eventually oxidized to CO2. Isoprene, alpha-pinene, methanol, carbon monoxide and other compounds emitted by terrestrial vegetation contribute about half of the total flux and are estimated to produce about 1 Pg C as CO2 per year. The global average for vegetated surfaces is about 7 g C m(-2) per year but could exceed 100 g m(-2) per year at some tropical locations. The magnitude of these fluxes on both the landscape and global scales are small relative to the total carbon emission or deposition but are significant relative to the net fluxes. Reactive carbon fluxes are very sensitive to landcover and climate change and may vary significantly due to future perturbations. This paper summarizes what is known about reactive carbon emissions from vegetation including the magnitude of local, landscape, and global scale fluxes and their contribution to atmospheric CO2. Reasons for including this term in carbon flux models are presented as well as the potential importance on various spatial scales. Past, present and future reactive carbon emissions are expected to differ significantly and the implications of this are discussed.},

abstract = {Atmospheric trace gases can partition between the atmosphere and the snow surface. Quantifying this partitioning requires the knowledge of the surface area (SA) of snow. Eleven samples were taken from a 50 cm thick snow fall at Col de Forte, near Grenoble (French Alps) between January 20 and February 4, 1998. Fresh snow and 3, 8, and 15 day-old snaw were sampled at three different depths. Surface hear, formed after the fall, was also sampled. Air and surface snow temperature, snow density, and snow fall rate were measured. Snow temperature always remained below freezing. Snow SA was measured using methane adsorption at 77.15 K. Values ranged from 2.25 m(2)/g for fresh snow to 0.25 m(2)/g for surface hear and surface snow after 15 days. These values are much too high to be explained by the macroscopic aspect of snow crystals, and microstructures such as small rime droplets must have been present Large decrease in SA with time were observed. The first meter of snowpack had a total surface area of about 50 000 m(2) per m(2) of ground. Reduction in SA will lead to the emission of adsorbed species by the snowpack, with possible considerable increase in atmospheric concentrations.},

We use Earth's measured energy imbalance, paleoclimate data, and simple representations of the global carbon cycle and temperature to define emission reductions needed to stabilize climate and avoid potentially disastrous impacts on today's young people, future generations, and nature. A cumulative industrial-era limit of ∼500 GtC fossil fuel emissions and 100 GtC storage in the biosphere and soil would keep climate close to the Holocene range to which humanity and other species are adapted. Cumulative emissions of ∼1000 GtC, sometimes associated with 2°C global warming, would spur "slow" feedbacks and eventual warming of 3-4°C with disastrous consequences. Rapid emissions reduction is required to restore Earth's energy balance and avoid ocean heat uptake that would practically guarantee irreversible effects. Continuation of high fossil fuel emissions, given current knowledge of the consequences, would be an act of extraordinary witting intergenerational injustice. Responsible policymaking requires a rising price on carbon emissions that would preclude emissions from most remaining coal and unconventional fossil fuels and phase down emissions from conventional fossil fuels.},

abstract = {Globally 15{\%}, and in Europe over 50{\%}, of all peatlands have been drained for agricultural use leading to high carbon (C) losses, severe land subsidence and increased flooding risks. For the restoration of C sequestration and peat formation, abandoned peatlands are being rewetted at a large scale, but this transforms them into strong methane (CH4) sources. Furthermore, due to the high topsoil nutrient contents and/or high buffering capacities of water used for rewetting, this will inevitably result in eutrophication of restored peatlands and downstream areas, which may compromise the regrowth of peat forming vegetation including Sphagnum spp. To experimentally determine the extent of these negative side effects in relation to water quality, and to test topsoil removal as an abatement strategy, we used a controlled laboratory approach in which topsoil and subsoil monoliths of a former agricultural peatland were rewetted with water of different qualities (+P, +HCO3−, +P/+HCO3− and Control), mimicking rainwater vs. surface water storage. In addition, two different Sphagnum moss species (S. squarrosum and S. palustre) were compared. Without topsoil removal, rewetting led to high P and N mobilisation, algal blooms, and high CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) emissions. P-rich water resulted in further eutrophication. Bicarbonate (HCO3−) enrichment by surface water not only stimulated P release and CO2 emission, but also strongly reduced Sphagnum vitality. We conclude that topsoil removal will, at least in initial stages of rewetting, strongly reduce eutrophication problems (by 80–90{\%}), CH4 emission (99{\%}), DOC loss (60{\%}) and global warming potential (50–70{\%}) of rewetted former agricultural peatlands. Furthermore, to reduce mineralisation rates and enable Sphagnum growth, storage of rainwater rather than surface water is preferred. Finally, removed topsoils can be reused in adjacent subsiding agricultural areas, and thereby optimise the overall C balance and allow higher water levels in rewetted peatlands.},

abstract = {Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

abstract = {The differential design, deployment and data post-processing of open- (OP) and closed-path (CP) eddy covariance systems is a potential source of bias for ongoing global flux synthesis activities. Here we use a unique six year data set of concurrent CP and OP carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour (H2O) eddy covariance flux measurements above a temperate mountain grassland in Austria to explore the consequences of these differences on a long-term basis. The theoretically based transfer function approach was able to account and correct for the differences in low-pass filtering between the two systems. Corrected CO2 and H2O fluxes exhibited excellent 1:1 correspondence, but the CP system tended to underestimate OP H2O fluxes during conditions of high air temperature, wind speed and global radiation, large sun angles and low relative humidity. Corrections for self-heating of the OP infra-red gas analyser had a very small effect on these relationships. Energy balance closure was slightly more favourable for the OP system. No significant differences were found for the random flux uncertainty of both systems. A larger fraction of OP data had to be excluded because of obstructions of the infra-red path by water and snow. This, however, did not translate into a correspondingly larger fraction of accepted CP flux values, because of a larger percentage of CP flux data failing on the stationarity test. Integrated over the annual cycle, the CP system yielded on average a more positive net ecosystem CO2 exchange (25 vs. 0 gC m(-2) y(-1)) and a lower evapotranspiration (465 vs. 549 mm y(-1)) as compared to the OP system.},

abstract = {The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained and converted to agriculture more than a century ago, and since then has experienced extreme rates of soil subsidence from peat oxidation. To reverse subsidence and capture carbon there is increasing interest in converting drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. Rice agriculture is proposed as a flooded land-use type with CO2 sequestration potential for this region. We conducted two years of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at a conventional drained and grazed degraded peatland and a newly converted rice paddy to evaluate the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2, CH4, and evaporation fluxes. We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175-299 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CO2 and 3.3 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84-283 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) of CO2 from the atmosphere and released 2.5-6.6 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4. The rice paddy evaporated 45-95{\%} more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net CO2 sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Questions: What are the long-term effects of climate change on the plant species composition and carbon sequestration in peat bogs? Methods: We developed a bog ecosystem model that includes vegetation, carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics. Two groups of vascular plant species and three groups of Sphagnum species compete with each other for light and nitrogen. The model was tested by comparing the outcome with long-term historic vegetation changes in peat cores from Denmark and England. A climate scenario was used to analyse the future effects of atmospheric CO2, temperature and precipitation. Results: The main changes in the species composition since 1766 were simulated by the model. Simulations for a future wanner, and slightly wetter, climate with doubling CO2 concentration suggest that little will change in species composition, due to the contrasting effects of increasing temperatures (favouring vascular plants) and CO2 (favouring Sphagnum). Further analysis of the effects of temperature showed that simulated carbon sequestration is negatively related to vascular plant expansion. Model results show that increasing temperatures may still increase carbon accumulation at cool, low N deposition sites, but decrease carbon accumulation at high N deposition sites. Conclusions: Our results show that the effects of temperature, precipitation, N-deposition and atmospheric CO2 are not straightforward, but interactions between these components of global change exist. These interactions are the result of changes in vegetation composition. When analysing long-term effects of global change, vegetation changes should be taken into account and predictions should not be based on temperature increase alone. {\textcopyright} IAVS; Opuius Press Uppsala.},

abstract = {Peatlands store approximately 30{\%} of global soil carbon, most in moss-dominated bogs. Future climatic changes, such as changes in precipitation patterns and warming, are expected to affect peat bog vegetation composition and thereby its long-term carbon sequestration capacity. Theoretical work suggests that an episode of rapid environmental change is more likely to trigger transitions to alternative ecosystem states than a gradual, but equally large, change in conditions. We used a dynamic vegetation model to explore the impacts of drought events and increased temperature on vegetation composition of temperate peat bogs. We analyzed the consequences of six patterns of summer drought events combined with five temperature scenarios to test whether an open peat bog dominated by moss (Sphagnum) could shift to a tree-dominated state. Unexpectedly, neither a gradual decrease in the amount of summer precipitation nor the occurrence of a number of extremely dry summers in a row could shift the moss-dominated peat bog permanently into a tree-dominated peat bog. The increase in tree biomass during drought events was unable to trigger positive feedbacks that keep the ecosystem in a tree-dominated state after a return to previous 'normal' rainfall conditions. In contrast, temperature increases from 1 °C onward already shifted peat bogs into tree-dominated ecosystems. In our simulations, drought events facilitated tree establishment, but temperature determined how much tree biomass could develop. Our results suggest that under current climatic conditions, peat bog vegetation is rather resilient to drought events, but very sensitive to temperature increases, indicating that future warming is likely to trigger persistent vegetation shifts.},

abstract = {Globally, peat lands are considered to be a sink of CO2, but a source when drained. Additionally, wet peat lands are thought to emit considerable amounts of CH4 and N2O. Hitherto, reliable and integrated estimates of emissions and emission factors for this type of land cover have been lacking and the effects of wetland restoration on methane emissions have been poorly quantified. In this paper we estimate the full greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a restored natural peat land by determining the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O through atmosphere and water, while accounting for the different Global Warming Potentials (GWP's). The site is an abandoned agricultural peat meadow, which has been converted into a wetland nature reserve ten years ago, after which the water level was raised. GHG fluxes were measured continuously with an eddy covariance system (CO2) and flux chamber measurements (CH4 and N2O). Meteorological and hydrological measurements were collected as well. With growing seasons of respectively 192, 168 and 129 days, the annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was -446+ +/- 83 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, -311 +/- 58 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and -232 +/- 57 g m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) was estimated as 869 +/- 668 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, 866 +/- 666 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 924 +/- 711 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. CH4 emissions from the saturated land and water surfaces were high compared to the relatively dry land. Annual weighted CH4 emissions were 31.27 +/- 20.40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 32.27 +/- 21.08 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. N2O fluxes were too low to be of significance. The water balance of the area was dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration and therefore fluxes of carbon and CH4 through seepage, infiltration and drainage were relatively small (17.25 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The carbon- balance consisted for the largest part of CO2 uptake, CO2 respiration and CH4 emission from water saturated land and water. CO2 emission has decreased significantly as result of the raised water table, while CH4 fluxes have increased. In GWP's the area was a small net GHG sink given as CO2- equiv. of - 86 g m(-2) yr(-1) (over a 100-year period).},

Total N deposition (estimated as wet nitrate [NO3(-)] and ammonium [NH4(+)] plus dry NO× and NH3) ranged from 2 to 22 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1) (mean=12 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1)) to grasslands. Empirical critical loads for nutrient N were set at 15 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1) for both acid and calcareous grasslands; exceedance was observed for {\~{}}35{\%} ({\~{}}2,311 km(2)) of mapped acid grasslands. In contrast, only {\~{}}9{\%} of calcareous grasslands ({\~{}}35 km(2)) received N deposition in excess of the critical load. Reduced N deposition (primarily dry NH3) represented the dominant form to grasslands (range 55-90{\%}) owing to significant emissions associated with livestock (primarily cattle). The extent of exceedance in acid grasslands suggests that N deposition to this habitat type may lead to adverse impacts such as a decline in plant species diversity and soil acidification. Further, given that elevated N deposition was dominated by NH3 associated with agricultural emissions rather than long-range transboundary sources, future improvements in air quality need to be driven by national policies.},

abstract = {Plant succession triggered by drainage, which results in the expansion or invasion of vascular plants, has been reported from many peatlands. However, the effects of the vascular plant's expansion on evapotranspiration (ET), which is a key component of the water balance of ombrotophic bog, are still contradictory. To investigate the effects, ET was measured at a Sphagnum-dominated bog and an adjacent transition peatland dominated by Sasa, dwarf bamboo, in Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, using the eddy covariance technique during the four growing seasons from 2007 through 2010. Cumulative gap-filled ET during a snow-free period of 6.5 months was 362 (2008) and 374mm (2010) at the Sphagnum site and 300 (2008) and 372mm (2010) at the Sasa site. In the mid-growing season (late June to mid-September) with the highest leaf area index (LAI) at the Sasa site, ET was 2.14±0.03 (mean±1 standard deviation of the four years) and 1.92±0.19mmd−1, respectively, at the Sphagnum and Sasa sites. ET was smaller at the Sasa site, except for 2010 with an unusual hot wet summer; mean air temperature and precipitation were higher than their 30-year normal values by 1.75°C and 172mm, respectively. At the Sphagnum site, ET was stable despite such interannual variation in meteorological conditions. However, ET increased significantly at the Sasa site in 2010 probably because of LAI increase due to the enhanced growth of Sasa plants. The ET increase at the Sasa site suggests that ET will increase at the Sasa-dominated area, if the future warming environment accompanies more precipitation.},

abstract = {A field-scale, natural gradient solute transport experiment conducted at a Newfoundland blanket bog resulted in an asymmetrical plume owing to solute retardation in the dual-porosity matrix. An order of magnitude decrease in hydraulic conductivity 10–20 m downslope of the spill caused the transport rate to decrease and lateral dispersion to increase. Most transport occurred near the watertable and the transport rate increased as the watertable rose. Hydraulic conductivity between a depth of 0 and 0.2 m was 1.6 × 10−2 m s−1 , whereas at a depth of 0.5 m it was 5–6 orders of magnitude lower owing to greater compaction and humification of the peat with depth. At a depth of 0.4–0.45 m diffusion may have become the dominant transport mechanism. In spite of the retardation process, the solute front's rate of movement was relatively high, about 2.3 m day−1, owing to a combination of the high watertable during the study and a relatively steep hydraulic gradient of 0.055. Rain caused dilution and mixing of solute near the watertable. Evaporation did not have an appreciable effect on solute concentration, which is attributable to the high transport rate.},

abstract = {Plant species composition is a potentially important source of variation in soil processes, including decomposition rates. We compared litter decomposition in two common and compositionally distinct tundra vegetation types in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaska: moist acidic tundra (soil pH 3-4), which occurs primarily on older landscapes, and moist non-acidic tundra (soil pH 6-7), which occurs primarily on landscapes with a more recent history of glaciation and has higher graminoid and forb abundance and lower woody shrub abundance than acidic tundra. To separate the influence of plant community composition from that of the soil environment, we decomposed the same nine substrates at a moist acidic and a moist non-acidic site located less than 2 km apart. Substrates included leaf litter of the dominant species in each growth form (graminoid, deciduous shrub, evergreen shrub, forb, moss) as well as woody stems of the deciduous shrub Betula nana. Then, we estimated above-ground community-level decomposition by weighting the decay rate of each species in the community by its proportional contribution to overall above-ground net primary production (ANPP). In contrast to our expectations, community-level decomposition rates estimated using the site-average decay rate for each substrate were similar between the two sites, likely because growth forms differed little in their leaf litter decay. By contrast, when site-specific decay rates were used to estimate community-level decomposition, it was nearly twice as fast at the older, moist acidic tundra site because most substrates decayed faster at that site, indicating a more favorable environment for decomposition in acidic tundra. Site differences in soil moisture and temperature could not explain site differences in decomposition. However, higher soil N availability at the moist acidic tundra may have contributed to faster decomposition since, in a separate experiment, fertilization with N stimulated decomposition of a common substrate at both sites. In addition, lower pH in acidic tundra may promote greater abundance of soil fungi, perhaps explaining faster decomposition rates at that site. In summary, the large differences in plant species composition between moist acidic and non-acidic tundra are likely to not contribute to site differences in decomposition. Nevertheless, decomposition is much more rapid in moist acidic tundra. Thus, landscape age and associated differences in soil pH and nutrient availability are important sources of variation in decomposition rate in upland Alaskan tundra.},

abstract = {Peatlands cover over 400 million hectares of the Earth's surface and store between one-third and one-half of the world's soil carbon pool. The long-term ability of peatlands to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere means that they play a major role in moderating global climate. Peatlands can also either attenuate or accentuate flooding. Changing climate or management can alter peatland hydrological processes and pathways for water movement across and below the peat surface. It is the movement of water in peats that drives carbon storage and flux. These small-scale processes can have global impacts through exacerbated terrestrial carbon release. This paper will describe advances in understanding environmental processes operating in peatlands. Recent (and future) advances in high-resolution topographic data collection and hydrological modelling provide an insight into the spatial impacts of land management and climate change in peatlands. Nevertheless, there are still some major challenges for future research. These include the problem that impacts of disturbance in peat can be irreversible, at least on human time-scales. This has implications for the perceived success and understanding of peatland restoration strategies. In some circumstances, peatland restoration may lead to exacerbated carbon loss. This will also be important if we decide to start to create peatlands in order to counter the threat from enhanced atmospheric carbon.},

abstract = {A key parameter used in wetland hydrological and landform development models is hydraulic conductivity. Head recovery tests are often used to measure hydraulic conductivity but the calculation techniques are usually confined to rigid soil theory. This is despite reports demonstrating the misapplication of rigid soil theory to non-rigid soils such as peats. While values of hydraulic conductivity calculated using compressible techniques have been presented for fenland peats these data have never, to the authors' knowledge, been compared to such calculations in other peat types. Head recovery tests (slug withdrawal) were performed on piezometers at depths ranging from 10 cm to 80 cm from the surface on north Pennine blanket peats. Results were obtained using both rigid and compressible soil theories allowing comparison of the two techniques. Compressible soil theory gives values for hydraulic conductivity that are typically a factor of five times less than rigid soil calculations. Hydraulic conductivity is often assumed to decrease with depth in upland peats but at the study site in the northern Pennines it was not found to vary significantly with depth within the range of peat depths sampled. The variance within depth categories was not significantly different to the variance between depth categories showing that individual peat layers did not have characteristic hydraulic conductivity values. Thus large lateral and vertical differences in hydraulic conductivity over short distances creates problems for modelling but may help account for the high frequency of preferential flow pathways within what is otherwise a low matrix hydraulic conductivity peat. Hydraulic conductivity was found to vary significantly between sampling sites demonstrating that hillslope or catchment-scale variability may be more important than plot-scale variability. Values for compressibility of the peats are also reported. These generally decline with depth and also vary significantly between sampling sites. There are implications for the way in which measurements of hydraulic conductivity and other properties of blanket peat are interpreted as the effects of environmental change in one part of a peat catchment may be very different to those in another.},

abstract = {The physical structures of snow and sea ice in the Arctic section of 150 degrees-180 degrees W were observed on the basis of snow-pit, ice-core, and drill-hole measurements from late July to late August 2010. Almost all the investigated floes were first-year ice, except for one located north of Alaska, which was probably multi-year ice transported from north of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago during early summer. The snow covers over all the investigated floes were in the melting phase, with temperatures approaching 0 C and densities of 295-398 kg/m(3). The snow covers can be divided into two to five layers of different textures, with most cases having a top layer of fresh snow, a round-grain layer in the middle, and slush and/or thin icing layers at the bottom. The first-year sea ice contained about 7{\%}-17{\%} granular ice at the top. There was no granular ice in the lower layers. The interior melting and desalination of sea ice introduced strong stratifications of temperature, salinity, density, and gas and brine volume fractions. The sea ice temperature exhibited linear cooling with depth, while the salinity and the density increased linearly with normalized depth from 0.2 to 0.9 and from 0 to 0.65, respectively. The top layer, especially the freeboard layer, had the lowest salinity and density, and consequently the largest gas content and the smallest brine content. Both the salinity and density in the ice basal layer were highly scattered due to large differences in ice porosity among the samples. The bulk average sea ice temperature, salinity, density, and gas and brine volume fractions were -0.8 degrees C, 1.8, 837 kg/m(3), 9.3{\%} and 10.4{\%}, respectively. The snow cover, sea ice bottom, and sea ice interior show evidences of melting during mid-August in the investigated floe located at about 87 degrees N, 175 degrees W},

abstract = {Two ombrotrophic bogs in Canada's Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), an area storing an estimated 33 Gt of soil carbon, are contrasted with the Mer Bleue temperate ombrotrophic bog approximately 1000 km to the southeast to assess the net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between these ecosystems and the atmosphere. Peatlands in the BBL region may be impacted by not only climate change but also resource extraction practices that may cause drying of surrounding areas. Two years of eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements show the two HBL bogs to be annual sinks for CO2. Given random error and gap-filling uncertainties of 6 to 13 g C m(-2) yr(-1), the annual budgets of 45 to 55 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the HBL bogs did not differ significantly from the temperate bog's budget of 55 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (in the first year) despite differences in climate and vegetation composition and abundance. The temperate bog did have significantly greater net uptake of CO2 (78 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in the second study year. Component fluxes of photosynthesis and respiration were much smaller at the HBL bogs and speculated to be a result of less vascular vegetation. Less growing season CO2 uptake at the HBL bogs was offset by less winter loss when compared to the temperate bog. The influence of mid-summer drying and lowered water tables was similar among all three bogs. Decreasing mid-summer net ecosystem productivity (NEP) appeared to be a result of reduced photosynthetic uptake rather than increased respiration. In the short-term, drying of the BBL peatlands might result in a decrease of their C sink strength.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy fluxes were measured above and within a maritime pine forest during an atypical year with long-lasting reduced soil water availability. Energy balance closure was adequately good at both levels. As compared with what is usually observed at this site the ecosystem dissipated less energy via latent heat flux and more via sensible heat flux. The understorey canopy was responsible for a variable, significant component of the whole canopy fluxes of water vapour and carbon dioxide. The annual contribution of the understorey was 38{\%} (154mm) of the overall evaporation (399mm) and 32{\%} (89mm) of the overall sensible heat flux (274mm). The participation of the understorey reached 45{\%} of the overall evaporation and 30{\%} of the daytime overall assimilation during significant soil water deficit periods in summertime. Even during winter, understorey photosynthesis was consistent as it compensated soil and understorey respiration. The ecosystem behaved as a sink of carbon, with a negative annual carbon budget (−57gCm−2). However, due to high soil water deficit, the annual ecosystem GPP was 40{\%} less than usually observed at this site. This budget resulted from a sink of −131gCm−2 for the overstorey and a source of +74gCm−2 for the understorey. Moreover, on an annual basis the overstorey layer contributed to almost two-thirds of the ecosystem respiration. Finally, the effect of long-lasting soil water deficit on the maritime pine forest was found more important than the effect of the heat wave and drought of summer 2003.},

abstract = {Thawing permafrost in the sub-Arctic has implications for the physical stability and biological dynamics of peatland ecosystems. This study provides an analysis of how permafrost thawing and subsequent vegetation changes in a sub-Arctic Swedish mire have changed the net exchange of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 over the past three decades. Images of the mire (ca. 17 ha) and surroundings taken with film sensitive in the visible and the near infrared portion of the spectrum, [i.e. colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs from 1970 and 2000] were used. The results show that during this period the area covered by hummock vegetation decreased by more than 11{\%} and became replaced by wet-growing plant communities. The overall net uptake of C in the vegetation and the release of C by heterotrophic respiration might have increased resulting in increases in both the growing season atmospheric CO2 sink function with about 16{\%} and the CH4 emissions with 22{\%}. Calculating the flux as CO2 equivalents show that the mire in 2000 has a 47{\%} greater radiative forcing on the atmosphere using a 100-year time horizon. Northern peatlands in areas with thawing sporadic or discontinuous permafrost are likely to act as larger greenhouse gas sources over the growing season today than a few decades ago because of increased CH4 emissions.},

This analysis can inform the choice of appropriate likelihood functions, thereby advancing hydrologic modeling with improved parameter and quantity estimates and more reliable assessment of uncertainty. For long-running models, the Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm offers spectacular reductions in time required for MCMC analysis. This is partly due to multiple parameter sets being evaluated simultaneously. The ability to use this feature is hindered in models that have a large number of input files, such as SWAT. A conceptually simple, robust method for applying DREAM to SWAT in R is provided. The general approach is transferrable to any executable that reads input files. We provide this approach to reduce barriers to the use of MCMC algorithms and to promote the development of appropriate likelihood functions.},

abstract = {Hydromorphic soils should exhibit higher climate change feedback potentials than well aerated soils since soil organic matter (SOM) losses in them are predicted to be much larger than those of well aerated soils. To evaluate a combined feedback relationship between groundwater level (GWL) and total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, a greenhouse microcosm experiment was performed by exposing three hydromorphic forest soil types that differed in carbon content to three water levels (−40, −20 and −5cm) while plants were excluded. Net GHG fluxes were measured continuously. GHG concentrations plus oxygen were measured in soil air and soil water at different depths. In this study, soil type hardly affected GHG emissions but GWL did. CO2 emissions peaked at GWL of −40cm and declined on average to 65 and 33{\%} during GWL at −20 and −5cm, respectively. CH4 emissions showed the opposite pattern having the highest emission rates at GWL of −5cm and compared to that on average only −3 and −8{\%} during GWL at −20 and −40cm, respectively. The highest mean N2O emissions were detected at the intermediate GWL of −20cm, whereas it is reduced on average to 18{\%} for GWL at −40cm and at −5cm. The highest greenhouse gas emissions (in CO2 equivalents) were calculated for GWL at −20cm. During GWL at −40cm, CO2 equivalent fluxes were only insignificantly lower. CO2 equivalent fluxes reduced explicitly in mean to 35{\%} with GWL at −5cm. The outcome emphasizes that anaerobic SOM decomposition apparently produces a lower warming potential than aerobic SOM decomposition. Undoubtedly, hydromorphic soils have to be considered for climate–carbon feedback scenarios.},

The main goal of our investigation was to deliver estimations of CH4 and N2O emission rates for this unique peatland type in Central Europe. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were also measured using a non-steady-state-flow-through manual chamber systems equipped with infrared gas analyzers and used to validate and adjust results obtained with the SIGMA system. The average methane fluxes for the 2009-2010 (excluding winter) period was 95.4 (+/- 32.4) mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) resulting in a cumulative CH4 emission of 23.4 (+/- 2.4) g CH4-C m(-2) A day growing season and 29.2 (+/- 3.2) g CH4-C m(-2) year(-1) for the whole of 2010. The average seasonal N2O fluxes were 13.6 (+/- 28.2) mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1). N2O fluxes were highly variable in time and sign (both uptake and emissions of N2O were observed during the accumulation periods). Maximum estimates of the annual emission rates of N2O were 0.004 g N2O-N m(-2) year(-1). Methane fluxes correlated significantly with the air and peat temperatures, but they were not dependent on water table depth. The N2O fluxes did not demonstrate a clear response to any environmental variables. Both CH4 and N2O emission rates were in the range of fluxes recorded in pristine peatlands in other climatic zones.},

Sphagnum height growth and cover decreased significantly in the high N treatment (6.4 g N m-2yr-1) in the 4th and 5th treatment years, while those of Polytrichum increased, relative to the control. Net CO2 exchange, gross photosynthesis (Pg) and dark respiration (R) in the intact moss cores, measured in the 5th treatment year, were elevated in the high N treatment relative to the control, associated with enhanced Polytrichum abundance. The moss cores where Polytrichum was removed, however, had increased mass-based R in the high N treatment. Our results showed ...},

abstract = {In this study latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) measurements made at 65 boreal and arctic eddy-covariance (EC) sites were analyses by using the Penman-Monteith equation. Sites were stratified into nine different ecosystem types: harvested and burnt forest areas, pine forests, spruce or fir forests, Douglas-fir forests, broadleaf deciduous forests, larch forests, wetlands, tundra and natural grasslands. The Penman-Monteith equation was calibrated with variable surface resistances against half-hourly eddy-covariance data and clear differences between ecosystem types were observed. Based on the modeled behavior of surface and aerodynamic resistances, surface resistance tightly control $\lambda$E in most mature forests, while it had less importance in ecosystems having shorter vegetation like young or recently harvested forests, grasslands, wetlands and tundra. The parameters of the Penman-Monteith equation were clearly different for winter and summer conditions, indicating that phenological effects on surface resistance are important. We also compared the simulated $\lambda$E of different ecosystem types under meteorological conditions at one site. Values of $\lambda$E varied between 15{\%} and 38{\%} of the net radiation in the simulations with mean ecosystem parameters. In general, the simulations suggest that $\lambda$E is higher from forested ecosystems than from grasslands, wetlands or tundra-type ecosystems. Forests showed usually a tighter stomatal control of $\lambda$E as indicated by a pronounced sensitivity of surface resistance to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. Nevertheless, the surface resistance of forests was lower than for open vegetation types including wetlands. Tundra and wetlands had higher surface resistances, which were less sensitive to vapor pressure deficits. The results indicate that the variation in surface resistance within and between different vegetation types might play a significant role in energy exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere. These results suggest the need to take into account vegetation type and phenology in energy exchange modeling.},

abstract = {In 2002 we set up three eddy covariance (EC) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux towers in the south of Ireland to measure continuously the fluxes of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface. The three ecosystems were located at: 1) a managed grassland at Dripsey, County Cork (elevation 190 m above sea level (m asl)); 2) an intensively managed grassland at Johnstown Castle, Wexford (elevation 58 m asl); and 3) an Atlantic blanket peatland at Glencar, County Kerry (elevation 150 m asl). At Dripsey, we also established an EC system for nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. In addition at Glencar we also established for more than two years (June 2003 to September 2005) a chamber flux experiment for CO2 and methane (CH4). At each of the three sites we also installed micrometeorological stations in 2002 for continuously recording key weather parameters (e.g. wind speed, air temperature, radiation, humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture etc). The project was funded by the Irish Environmental Protection Association (EPA) under the ERTDI Capability building programme. This report documents the results of five years of measurements and analysis (2002 to 2007). Forests have been studied much more extensively internationally than either grasslands or peatlands and the CO2 sink for forests in temperate humid climates has been found to range from about -5 to -15 tC-CO2 ha-1 yr-1 (negative sign indicates a sink). By comparison with forests, grasslands and peatlands in temperate climates have been reported to be either small sinks or small sources for CO2. For each of the five years of study, the three sites were sinks for CO2. The peatland was a small sink for CO2 (annual average of -0.6 tC ha-1 yr-1) while the two grasslands Dripsey and Wexford were sinks for CO2 (of annual average -2.6 tC ha-1 yr-1 and -4.8 tC ha-1 yr-1 respectively). The Wexford grassland for 2006 and 2007, had a mixed land cover (part grassland and part winter kale, a fodder crop) which resulted in a significant reduction of the size of the CO2 sink (- 1.75 tC ha-1 yr-1). The N2O emissions at the Dripsey grassland ranged from +1.6 to +8.6 kg N-N2O ha-1 yr-1. which corresponded to 1.4{\%} to 4.2{\%} of the applied nitrogen in artificial fertiliser. The N2O emissions in Global Warming Potential (GWP) terms have the effect of reducing the beneficial CO2 uptake by {\~{}} 20{\%}. The emissions of CH4 at the peatland averaged 0.05 tC-CH4 ha-1 yr-1 which was {\~{}} 10{\%} of the annually averaged C-CO2 sink. The small annual sink of CO2 and high interannual variability at the Atlantic blanket peatland suggests that under climate change predictions (with wetter winters and drier summers and warmer throughout the year), blanket peatlands are likely to become sources rather than remain as sinks for CO2. The huge store of carbon in Irish peatlands is in danger of being lost to the atmosphere. A national committee should be engaged to charter the best route for Ireland through this likely change. The wet impeded drainage gley grassland soils at Dripsey are a robust sink for CO2, even under a wide range of interannual variability in rainfall. Under climate change, wetter winters are unlikely to reduce the CO2 uptake, but warmer springs and summers and an earlier start to the growing season coupled with a longer growing season will enhance the annual CO2 sink. The free draining brown earth soils in Wexford are a significant sink for CO2. Under climate change, wetter winters are unlikely to reduce the CO2 uptake, but warmer summers and an earlier start to the growing season coupled with a longer growing season may enhance the annual CO2 sink. However, if summer droughts occur as a result of drier warmer summers (which are predicted for the South-East) then the CO2 sink may not be enhanced. To increase the CO2 uptake and reduce the N2O emissions from grasslands, alternative grassland management practices to widespread nitrogen (N) fertilisation and silage making should be examined. These include: reduction of N (in fertilisers and slurry) in accordance with the EU Nitrate Directive; wider use of less intensive grassland management practices, such as REPS; wider use of clover grasses (as an N fixer); later first cut silage which would extend the growing season length and enhance CO2 sink. A multi-annual experiment including modelling on same soils should compare the CO2 uptake (and the impact on N2O emissions) between: grazed fields; silage fields (with different timing of the first cut); REPS fields; and clover grass fields. It is also recommended to continue the CELTICFLUX greenhouse gas experiments on grasslands on a range of soil types and management practices, and so capture the interannual variability of climate change with expected changes in greenhouse gas fluxes.},

abstract = {One of the key questions in climate change research relates to the future dynamics of the large amount of C that is currently stored in soil organic matter. Will the amount of C in this pool increase or decrease with global warming? The future trend in amounts of soil organic C will depend on the relative temperature sensitivities of net primary productivity and soil organic matter decomposition rate. Equations for the temperature dependence of net primary productivity have been widely used, but the temperature dependence of decomposition rate is less clear. The literature was surveyed to obtain the temperature dependencies of soil respiration and N dynamics reported in different studies. Only laboratory-based measurements were used to avoid confounding effects with differences in litter input rates, litter quality, soil moisture or other environmental factors. A considerable range of values has been reported, with the greatest relative sensitivity of decomposition processes to temperature having been observed at low temperatures. A relationship fitted to the literature data indicated that the rate of decomposition increases with temperature at 0°C with a Q10 of almost 8. The temperature sensitivity of organic matter decomposition decreases with increasing temperature, indicated by the Q10 decreasing with temperature to be about 4.5 at 10°C and 2.5 at 20°C. At low temperatures, the temperature sensitivity of decomposition was consequently much greater than the temperature sensitivity of net primary productivity, whereas the temperature sensitivities became more similar at higher temperatures. The much higher temperature sensitivity of decomposition than for net primary productivity has important implications for the store of soil organic C in the soil. The data suggest that a 1°C increase in temperature could ultimately lead to a loss of over 10{\%} of soil organic C in regions of the world with an annual mean temperature of 5°C, whereas the same temperature increase would lead to a loss of only 3{\%} of soil organic C for a soil at 30°C. These differences are even greater in absolute amounts as cooler soils contain greater amounts of soil organic C. This analysis supports the conclusion of previous studies which indicated that soil organic C contents may decrease greatly with global warming and thereby provide a positive feed-back in the global C cycle.},

@article{Koebsch2015,
abstract = {Wetlands are the largest natural sources for atmospheric methane (CH4). In wetlands with permanent shallow inundation, the seasonal variation of CH4 exchange is mainly controlled by temperature and phenology. In addition, ecosystem CH4 exchange varies considerably on smaller temporal scales such as days or weeks. Several single processes that control CH4 emissions on the local soil–plant–atmosphere continuum are well investigated, but their interaction on ecosystem level is not well understood yet. We applied wavelet analysis to a quasi-continuous eddy covariance CH4 flux time series to describe the temporal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange within the growing season of a permanently inundated temperate fen. Moreover, we addressed time scale-specific controls and investigated whether their impact changes during the course of the growing season. On large time scales of two weeks to three months, temperature explained most of the variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange. In general, the temperature in the shallow water column had the largest impact as explanatory variable, however, air temperature and soil temperature became increasingly important as explanatory variables when water level dropped slightly up to June. The diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange shifted during the course of the growing season: During a short time period at the end of April, plant activity (expressed by canopy photosynthesis) caused a diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange with peak time around noon. In the following weeks, the daily cycle of convective mixing within the water column (expressed by the water temperature gradient) gradually gained importance and caused high night-time CH4 emissions, thereby levelling off the diurnal CH4 emission pattern. Moreover, shear-induced turbulence caused short-term fluctuations of ecosystem CH4 exchange on time scales up to two hours. Our study highlights the need for multi-scale approaches that consider the non-stationarity of the underlying processes to adequately describe the complexity of ecosystem CH4 exchange. Moreover, we show that CH4 release processes such as convective mixing of the water column which have been mainly considered for aquatic ecosystems (see recent exceptions in Godwin et al., 2013; Poindexter and Variano, 2013) might also be of importance in shallowly flooded terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured in a patterned peatland with eddy covariance (EC) and chamber methods during a 12-month period. The peatland surface was composed of microforms characterized by a difference in water level and vegetation composition. The distribution of microforms varied spatially within the peatland. To achieve correspondent half-hourly EC and chamber NEE estimates, we modelled microform level chamber fluxes, estimated them at each instance of weather recordings and integrated them over the year. We then scaled the fluxes up to the EC footprint. On a half-hourly time scale the correlation coefficient (R) of the NEE between the methods was 0.80 and the slope of regression 0.91. Measurements made in summer and during daylight were more highly correlated than measurements made in winter and during darkness. When integrated on a monthly time scale the methods agreed better, with R of 0.98 and slope of regression 1.00. The annual NEE for the EC and chamber methods were 206 and 242g(CO2)m−2, respectively. The study confirmed that the surface pattern of the EC footprint in the blanket bog was sufficiently homogeneous, that the changing wind direction did not influence the half-hourly NEE. However, the chamber estimates found that the annual NEE of the driest area within the footprint was 130{\%} larger than that in the wettest area, indicating that large spatial variation can be found in NEE.},

abstract = {Fens represent a large array of ecosystem services, including the highest biodiversity found among wetlands, hydrological services, water purification and carbon sequestration. Land-use change and drainage has severely damaged or annihilated these services in many parts of North America and Europe; restoration plans are urgently needed at the landscape level. We review the major constraints on the restoration of rich fens and fen water bodies in agricultural areas in Europe and disturbed landscapes in North America: (i) habitat quality problems: drought, eutrophication, acidification, and toxicity, and (ii) recolonization problems: species pools, ecosystem fragmentation and connectivity, genetic variability, and invasive species; and here provide possible solutions. We discuss both positive and negative consequences of restoration measures, and their causes. The restoration of wetland ecosystem functioning and services has, for a long time, been based on a trial-and-error approach. By presenting research and practice on the restoration of rich fen ecosystems within agricultural areas, we demonstrate the importance of biogeochemical and ecological knowledge at different spatial scales for the management and restoration of biodiversity, water quality, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, especially in a changing climate. We define target processes that enable scientists, nature managers, water managers and policy makers to choose between different measures and to predict restoration prospects for different types of deteriorated fens and their starting conditions.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that biogeochemical processes in the Arctic during late winter and spring-thaw strongly affect the annual cycling of carbon and nutrients, indicating high susceptibility to climate change. We therefore examined the carbon and nutrient dynamics in a sub-arctic heath and a birch forest with high temporal resolution from March until snowmelt at both ambient and experimentally increased snow depths. Ecosystem respiration (ER) from mid-March to snowmelt at ambient snow was high, reaching 99 +/- 19 (birch) and 67 +/- 1.4 g C m(-2) (heath). Enhanced snow depth by about 20-30 cm increased ER by 77-157{\%} during late winter but had no effects during spring-thaw. ER rates at the birch site were poorly described by classic first-order exponential models (R-2 = 0.06-0.10) with temperature as a single variable, but model fit improved considerably by including the supply of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or nitrogen (DON) in the model (R-2 = 0.40-0.47). At the heath, model fit with temperature as the single variable was better (R-2 = 0.38-0.52), yet it improved when the supply of DOC or DON was included (R-2 = 0.65-0.72). Microbial carbon decreased by 43{\%} within a few days after the first soil freeze-thaw event, while microbial nitrogen and phosphorus decreased more slowly. Because soil inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were low, nutrients released from lysed microbial cells may have been sequestered by surviving microbes or by plants resuming growth. The fast change in microbial biomass and the dependence of ER on substrate availability stress the need for high temporal resolution in future research on ecosystem carbon and nutrient dynamics at snowmelt in order to make robust models of their turnover.},

abstract = {Wetlands offer many social and ecological benefits, including by being highly productive environments, regulating climate and the global nitrogen cycle, supporting biological diversity, providing recreational and cultural services, reducing flood peaks, retaining sediment and contaminants, purifying water, acting as preferred groundwater recharge and discharge areas and providing habitat for wildlife. However, wetlands in urban regions are often threatened by development, which can fragment them, thus reducing the biodiversity and long term survival of such wetlands. On average, 50–55{\%} of total wetland area has been lost in the United States and Canada since the European settlement. Many communities have therefore developed strategies, regulations and programs to protect their remaining wetlands. These initiatives often require that permit providers or planners who design such conservation strategies evaluate the costs and benefits of wetlands to society, but rarely that they define a method for this assessment. This study presents a method that was developed in collaboration with the City of Quebec to systematically assess the ecological value of wetlands within its boundaries. An index was created with a group of experts using the MACBETH approach. This process resulted in all 1347 wetland complexes in Quebec City being classified based on their ecological value. The model created on the basis of the decisions taken by consensus during the workshop appears to be an effective tool to provide an overview of the wetlands in Quebec City. The results are convincing and they accurately represent the perceptions expressed by the expert panel.},

abstract = {Tussocks formed by Carex stricta are a relatively large carbon (C) pool in sedge meadows, but the stability of organic matter in these ecosystems is not well understood. We initiated year-long incubation experiments (22.5 degrees C) to evaluate the CO2 and CH4 production potentials of sedge meadow substrates under field moist and inundated treatments from five sites in the Upper Midwest, USA (4 reference, I restored). C mineralization potentials decreased with depth (tussocks {\textgreater} underlying soil), and were positively correlated with macro-organic matter content and negatively with lignin. Across sites, C stored in tussocks and soil at the restoration was the least stable, suggesting that the restoration of C-storage function may take decades. Mineralization potentials were similar between field moist and inundated treatments, but inundation resulted in higher methane production, accounting for 24-51{\%} of total carbon mineralized from tussocks. In the field however, C stricta tussocks emitted less methane (393 +/- 76 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) than tussock interspaces (1362 +/- 371 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) early in the growing season; we suggest that tussock tops oxidized methane produced from deeper anoxic horizons. Our results highlight the importance of considering how microtopography modulates greenhouse gas flux from wetlands and suggests that the C stored in the older, more decomposed C stricta tussock sedge meadow substrates (both within and between sites) is relatively stable.

abstract = {Over the last century, afforestation in Ireland has increased from 1{\%} of the land area to 10{\%}, with most plantations on upland drained blanket peatlands. This land use change is considered to have altered the hydrological response and water balance of upland catchments with implications for water resources. Because of the difficulty of observing these long-term changes in the field, the aim of this study was to utilize a hydrological model to simulate the rainfall runoff processes of an existing pristine blanket peatland and then to simulate the hydrology of the peatland if it were drained and afforested. The hydrological rainfall runoff model (GEOtop) was calibrated and validated for an existing small (76 ha) pristine blanket peatland in the southwest of Ireland for the 2-year period, 2007–2008. The current hydrological response of the pristine blanket peatland catchment with regard to streamflow and water table (WT) levels was captured well in the simulations. Two land use change scenarios of afforestation were also examined, (A) a young 10-year-old and (B) a semi-mature 15-year-old Sitka Spruce forest. Scenario A produced similar streamflow dynamics to the pristine peatland, whereas total annual streamflow from Scenario B was 20{\%} lower. For Scenarios A and B, on an annual average basis, the WT was drawn down by 16 and 20 cm below that observed in the pristine peatland, respectively. The maximum WT draw down in Scenario B was 61 cm and occurred in the summer months, resulting in a significant decrease in summer streamflow. Occasionally in the winter (following rainfall), the WT for Scenario B was just 2 cm lower than the pristine peatland, which when coupled with the drainage networks associated with afforestation led to higher peak streamflows.},

abstract = {Simulations of long-term ({\textgreater} 20 year) soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics by the DNDC model were compared with field observations at 11 plots in 5 field stations in Europe and Australia. The exercise was part of a NATO-sponsored workshop on long-term monitoring and modeling of soil organic matter. Eight of the eleven plots were cultivated cropland and three were grassland (harvested for hay). There were a range of fertilizer and manure treatments, as well as crop rotation sequences. Significant loss in SOC was observed at two plots in Australia where a grassland had been converted to cultivated cropland in 1925. Both field data and model simulations showed the plots reaching a new SOC equilibrium at about 44{\%} of the 1925 levels. Equilibrium levels depended on crop rotation sequence, with higher SOC for the plot with less frequent fallowing. At one permanent grassland site at Rothamsted, UK, a large decline and recovery in SOC was observed in the field, but not in the model simulation. For all other cases, both field and model data showed relatively small changes in SOC, though field data tended to be more variable, perhaps due to variability in both crop and weed yield, and in residue management. Mean percent differences between simulated and measured SOC were 0.07{\%} or less (as percent by weight, kilogram SOC/kilogram soil) for all but one of the plots simulated.},

abstract = {Natural wetlands are among the most important sources of atmospheric methane and thus important for better understanding the long-term temporal variations in the atmospheric methane concentration. During the last 60 years, wetlands have experienced extensive conversion and impacts from climate warming which might result in complicated temporal and spatial variations in the changes of the wetland methane emissions. In this paper, we present a modeling framework, integrating CH4MODwetland, TOPMODEL, and TEM models, to analyze the temporal and spatial variations in CH4 emissions from natural wetlands (including inland marshes/swamps, coastal wetlands, lakes, and rivers) in China. Our analysis revealed a total increase of 25.5 {\%}, averaging 0.52 g m−2 per decade, in the national CH4 fluxes from 1950 to 2010, which was mainly induced by climate warming. Larger CH4 flux increases occurred in northeastern, northern, and northwestern China, where there have been higher temperature rises. However, decreases in precipitation due to climate warming offset the increment of CH4 fluxes in these regions. The CH4 fluxes from the wetland on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau exhibited the lowest CH4 increase (0.17 g m−2 per decade). Although climate warming has accelerated CH4 fluxes, the total amount of national CH4 emissions decreased by approximately 2.35 Tg (1.91–2.81 Tg), i.e., from 4.50 Tg in the early 1950s to 2.15 Tg in the late 2000s, due to the wetland loss totalling 17.0 million ha. Of this reduction, 0.26 Tg (0.24–0.28 Tg) was derived from lakes and rivers, 0.16 Tg (0.13–0.20 Tg) from coastal wetlands, and 1.92 Tg (1.54–2.33 Tg) from inland wetlands. Spatially, northeastern China contributed the most to the total reduction, with a loss of 1.68 Tg. The wetland CH4 emissions reduced by more than half in most regions in China except for the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, where the CH4 decrease was only 23.3 {\%}.},

The half-monthly nighttime respiration rates in the central part of the growing season were about two times higher in the southernmost, warmest site, F{\"{a}}je, as compared to the northernmost, coldest site, Kaamanen. However, Kaamanen had high photosynthesis rates, and this in combination with the long daylight periods in the middle of the summer caused Kaamanen to have the largest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during the summer period. F{\"{a}}je that showed the highest productivity had also the highest respiration and therefore, the lowest NEE during summer. Correlation between half-monthly components and different environmental variables showed the highest correlation between the components themselves. Thereafter came temperature except for F{\"{a}}je where water table depth (WTD) explained most of the variance both for detrended and temperature-normalized components. All sites showed dependencies between WTD and the respective components during drying up periods. Temperature sensitivity was higher for productivity than for respiration indicating that CO2 uptake would increase during global warming.},

abstract = {The ROMUL decomposition model describes the flux of soil organic matter through the soil decomposition process separately for the organic layer (forest floor) and mineral soil. In the original ROMUL the effect of soil moisture on soil organic matter decomposition was described by using gravimetric soil water content, a parameter that is often difficult to obtain when the model is applied using continuous weather data. The new decomposition rate functions based on a soil respiration model use volumetric soil water content, replacing the original moisture functions with new ones. This paper also describes the development of a simple volumetric soil water model, with separate water storage compartments for the organic and mineral soil layers to better correspond with the structure of the ROMUL model. A volumetric soil model is also easier to adapt to various locations than the gravimetric soil water model. The new decomposition rate functions employing the new soil water model were tested by re-simulating a previous application of the ROMUL model to a forest site representing conditions in Southern Finland. Whereas the original ROMUL model underestimated the steady-state soil carbon stock of the site, the new model structure considerably reduced the decomposition rates, and the revised soil carbon storage estimates are now in good agreement with the measured data.},

abstract = {Peatlands have been widely developed for pasture usage through drainage and with the introduction of forage grasses; however, the effects of drainage and plant community change on methane (CH4) emission have not yet been well addressed. In this study, CH4 emissions, environmental factors, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were investigated across a disturbance gradient (i.e., the natural peatlands, the drained peatlands, and an abandoned peatland pasture). Our results show that in addition to temperature and water table, the substrate availability (DOC as a proxy) is also an important regulator of CH4 emission. For example, DOC, peat temperature at 5cm depth (T5), and water table depth (WTD) jointly explained 53{\%} of the temporal variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux for the hollows. Also, DOC was observed to be significantly correlated with the log-transformed CH4 flux for each land form. After the data were split into wet and dry seasons based on the water table, we observed that the T5 was the main driver of the CH4 flux during the wet season (R2=0.13), while WTD replaced it during the dry season (R2=0.23) for the general peatland system (i.e., all plots taken together). For the hummocks, both T5 and WTD together explained 31{\%} of the variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux during the wet season, and peat temperature at 20cm depth explained 16{\%} of the variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux during the dry season, while neither T5 nor WTD was correlated with the log-transformed CH4 flux across the whole season. These results imply that the relationships between environmental factors and CH4 flux depend on the water table and land forms. Our results indicate that water table drawdown is the main driver of the CH4 emission decrease at the non-inundated sites, and it explained 72{\%} of the variance in seasonal mean CH4 emission among sites. The drainage ditches of the drained peatlands and the abandoned pasture, in spite of covering only ∼5{\%} of the land area, contributed 15{\%} and 32{\%} of the CH4 emission of the land use type, respectively, and therefore represent a “hot spot” of CH4 emissions. High CH4 emission rates from the ditches, especially of the abandoned pasture, can be attributed to the higher production and export of DOC as a result of the rigorous vegetation growth. Spatially weighted CH4 emissions from May to October were1.87±0.68g CH4m−2 for the natural peatlands, 1.08±0.35g CH4m−2 for the drained peatlands, and 1.40±0.28g CH4m−2 for the abandoned pasture. Our results suggest that it is critical to measure the CH4 emission from the drainage ditches, where fresher substrate with a higher quality is transferred from the vegetated portion of the drained peatlands, in order to accurately evaluate the effects of agricultural development on the CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands.},

abstract = {Many wetland ecosystems such as peatlands and wet tundra hold large amounts of organic carbon (C) in their soils, and are thus important in the terrestrial C cycle. We have synthesized data on the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange obtained from eddy covariance measurements from 12 wetland sites, covering 120137 years at each site, across Europe and North America, ranging from ombrotrophic and minerotrophic peatlands to wet tundra ecosystems, spanning temperate to arctic climate zones. The average summertime net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was highly variable between sites. However, all sites with complete annual datasets, seven in total, acted as annual net sinks for atmospheric CO2. To evaluate the influence of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) on NEE, we first removed the artificial correlation emanating from the method of partitioning NEE into GPP and Reco. After this correction neither Reco (P= 0.162) nor GPP (P= 0.110) correlated significantly with NEE on an annual basis. Spatial variation in annual and summertime Reco was associated with growing season period, air temperature, growing degree days, normalized difference vegetation index and vapour pressure deficit. GPP showed weaker correlations with environmental variables as compared with Reco, the exception being leaf area index (LAI), which correlated with both GPP and NEE, but not with Reco. Length of growing season period was found to be the most important variable describing the spatial variation in summertime GPP and Reco; global warming will thus cause these components to increase. Annual GPP and NEE correlated significantly with LAI and pH, thus, in order to predict wetland C exchange, differences in ecosystem structure such as leaf area and biomass as well as nutritional status must be taken into account.},

abstract = {Peatlands are generally small sinks for atmospheric CO 2 . However, the sustainability of this sink functioning is threatened in a changing climate. We measured the CO 2 exchange in a temperate bog between August 2005 and July 2006 using the eddy covariance technique. During this period, the CO 2 balance was –78.6 ± 20.0 g CO 2 m -2 yr -1 , which is a lower uptake than others have reported for comparable ecosystems, but in accordance with average Holocene uptake rates. Average winter emissions were small (11 $\mu$ g CO 2 m -2 s -1 ), but the accumulated non-growing season fluxes (121 g CO 2 m -2 ) represent a larger flux than the annual balance. Taking into consideration that wintertime temperatures in the northern hemisphere are expected to increase in the future, wintertime fluxes may become increasingly important. The highest instantaneous monthly average uptake occurred in June (–38 $\mu$ g CO 2 m -2 s -1 ), while the drier month of July showed a distinctly smaller sink (–22 $\mu$ g CO 2 m -2 s -1 ). It is suggested that soil drying caused gross primary production to decline, while nighttime respiration showed a steadily increase. Our findings indicate that the effect of future warmer temperatures on the growing season CO 2 exchange in peatlands is dependent on soil wetness. DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0889.2007.00303.x},

abstract = {Global warming is predicted to be most pronounced at high latitudes, and observational evidence over the past 25 years suggests that this warming is already under way. One-third of the global soil carbon pool is stored in northern latitudes, so there is considerable interest in understanding how the carbon balance of northern ecosystems will respond to climate warming. Observations of controls over plant productivity in tundra and boreal ecosystems have been used to build a conceptual model of response to warming, where warmer soils and increased decomposition of plant litter increase nutrient availability, which, in turn, stimulates plant production and increases ecosystem carbon storage. Here we present the results of a long-term fertilization experiment in Alaskan tundra, in which increased nutrient availability caused a net ecosystem loss of almost 2,000 grams of carbon per square meter over 20 years. We found that annual aboveground plant production doubled during the experiment. Losses of carbon and nitrogen from deep soil layers, however, were substantial and more than offset the increased carbon and nitrogen storage in plant biomass and litter. Our study suggests that projected release of soil nutrients associated with high-latitude warming may further amplify carbon release from soils, causing a net loss of ecosystem carbon and a positive feedback to climate warming.},

abstract = {Eddy-covariance measurements, which were performed in the summer 2003 in an alpine grassland site, were used to determine the footprint of CO2 turbulent fluxes and to investigate its dependence on stability. The analysis is based on the spatial variability of carbon sinks generated by the difference in the time of the cutting of two concentric portions of the footprint, located outside and inside the fence surrounding the eddy tower, at approximately 30m distance. Due to this time difference, turbulent flux measurements were performed both in homogeneous (BEFORE and AFTER cutting) and heterogeneous (BETWEEN cuts) condition of spatial sink distribution. The analysis is based exclusively on daytime measurements. Half-hourly records ranked in two stability classes were used to calculate light response functions separately for three 10-day periods (BEFORE, BETWEEN and AFTER cutting). The contribution of the area inside the fence to the total flux was determined for different photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) values considering the BETWEEN cuts light response curve as a weighted average of the BEFORE and AFTER ones. The weight of the BEFORE cutting light response curve has been analytically determined and corresponds to the flux fraction which originates from inside the fence. The experimental estimates of the relative importance of the area inside the fence produced values ranging from 30{\%}, during stable conditions, and up to 80{\%} during unstable conditions. These values derived from observations were later compared with the predictions of three analytical footprint models. One of the models systematically underestimated experimental observations, while observations concurred with the other two, particularly in moderately unstable conditions.},

abstract = {Seven years of continuous eddy covariance measurements at an alpine meadow were used to investigate the impacts of climate drivers and ecosystem responses on the inter-annual variability (IAV) of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The annual cumulative value of NEE was positive (source) in 2003, 2005 and 2009 (50, 15 and 112gm−2 respectively) and negative (sink) in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 (29, 75, 110 and 28gm−2 respectively). The IAV of carbon dioxide fluxes builds up in two phenological phases: the onset of the growing season (triggered by snow melting) and the canopy re-growth after mowing. Respiratory fluxes during the non-growing season were observed to increase IAV, while growing season uptake dampened it. A novel approach was applied to factor out the two main sources of IAV: climate drivers' variability and changes in the ecosystem responses to climate. Annual values of carbon dioxide fluxes were calculated assuming (a) variable climate and variable ecosystem response among years, (b) variable climate and constant ecosystem response and (c) constant climate and variable ecosystem response. The analysis of flux variances calculated under these three assumptions indicates the occurrence of an important negative feedback between climate and ecosystem responses. Due to this feedback, the observed IAV of NEE is lower than one would expect for a given climate variability, because of the counteracting changes in ecosystem responses. This alpine meadow therefore demonstrates the ability to acclimatise and to limit the IAV of carbon fluxes induced by climate variability.},

abstract = {Pressure pumping at the Earth's surface is caused by short-period atmospheric turbulence, longer-period barometric changes, and quasi-static pressure fields induced by wind blowing across irregular topography. These naturally occurring atmospheric pressure variations induce periodic fluctuations in airflow through snowpacks, soils, and any other porous media at the Earth's surface. Consequently, the uptake or release of trace-gases from soils and snowpacks is a combination of molecular diffusion and advection forced by pressure pumping. Using model-estimated fluxes, this study attempts to quantify the influence that turbulent pressure fluctuations with periods between 0.1 and 1000 s can have on the rate of exchange of CO2, N2O, and CH4 through a seasonal snowpack. Data for this study were collected at a forested subalpine meadow site in the Rocky Mountains of southern Wyoming, during February 1995 when the snowpack was distinctly layered and approximately 1.4 m deep. The data include mole fraction of CO2, N2O, and CH4 just above and at the base of the snowpack, several profiles of CO2, N2O, and CH4 mole fraction in the top 1 m of the snowpack, and a profile of snowpack density and tortuosity. Turbulent atmospheric pressure-pumping fluctuations, sampled at approximately 11 Hz for several hours, were obtained with a fast response differential pressure sensor. A one-dimensional steady state diffusion model and one- and three-dimensional time-dependent pressure-pumping models are used to estimate the gas fluxes through the snowpack. Boundary conditions are provided by grab samples just above the snowpack and at the soil/snow interface. The pressure-pumping models are driven by the observed pressure fluctuations, and all models include the observed layering of the snowpack. As with previous studies the present results indicate that the effects of pressure pumping are diminished with increasingly strong gradients. Furthermore, we conclude that unless pressure pumping influences the gas concentrations at the boundaries of the snowpack, it appears unlikely that it can significantly impact the rate of gaseous diffusion through the snowpack. Even two-and three-dimensional effects, which can have a significant shortterm impact on the flues and concentration profiles, are nearly eliminated when averaged over a period of hours. It is also suggested that vertical layering is important for three-dimensional pressure-pumping studies and that the time-dependent temperature term, which is traditionally ignored when modeling dynamic pressure variations, may in fact be dominant in some situations and probably should be incorporated in future modeling studies of pressure pumping.},

abstract = {Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 through a seasonal snowpack were measured in and adjacent to a subalpine wetland in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Gas diffusion through the snow was controlled by gas production or consumption in the soil and by physical snowpack properties. The snowpack insulated soils from cold midwinter air temperatures allowing microbial activity to continue through the winter. All soil types studied were net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere through the winter, whereas saturated soils in the wetland center were net emitters of CH4 and soils adjacent to the wetland were net CH4 consumers. Most sites showed similar temporal patterns in winter gas fluxes; the lowest fluxes occurred in early winter, and maximum fluxes occurred at the onset of snowmelt. Temporal changes in fluxes probably were related to changes in soil-moisture conditions and hydrology because soil temperatures were relatively constant under the snowpack. Average winter CO2 fluxes were 42.3, 31.2, and 14.6 mmol m−2 d−1 over dry, moist, and saturated soils, respectively, which accounted for 8 to 23{\%} of the gross annual CO2 emissions from these soils. Average winter CH4 fluxes were −0.016, 0.274, and 2.87 mmol m−2 d−1 over dry, moist, and saturated soils, respectively. Microbial activity under snow cover accounted for 12{\%} of the annual CH4 consumption in dry soils and 58 and 12{\%} of the annual CH4 emitted from moist and saturated soils, respectively. The observed ranges in CO2 and CH4 flux through snow indicated that winter fluxes are an important part of the annual carbon budget in seasonally snow-covered terrains.},

@article{McVeigh2014,
abstract = {This study aims to develop models to describe CO2 fluxes in terms of environmental and meteorological variables and their variation over an Atlantic blanket bog in Glencar, southwest Ireland. Ten full years (September 2002-August 2012) of data were included in the assessment of CO2 flux and micrometeorological data. Models were based on non-gapfilled growing season data, using complete calendar years for annual models, and the entire time-series for weekly models, whilst taking interaction between variables into account for increased model accuracy. This was to determine which environmental variables were most influential in directly controlling CO2 exchange on a long- and short-term basis. A homogeneity of slopes (HOS) model was used to determine if there was any ecosystem response to indirect effects (functional response) of environmental or meteorological interannual variation. This model uses multiple regression analysis to determine if the ecosystem response can be better predicted as a linear function of the variables using a single slope model for all years, or a separate slopes model for each year. The separate slopes model gave a different (and improved) outcome for both daytime and night-time CO2 fluxes, and so functional responses were deemed to have occurred. The contribution to variation of day and night-time net ecosystem exchange (NEEday and NEEnight respectively) was then separated into four components: indirect functional responses, direct interannual meteorological variability, direct week to week meteorological variability, and random error, which identified 13.8{\%}, 36.6{\%}, 28.2{\%} and 21.4{\%} respectively of the variation in NEEday, as well as 23.4{\%}, 24.4{\%}, 22.2{\%} and 30{\%} respectively of the variation in NEEnight. Water table level (WTL) had the greatest influence upon functional variation of NEE at the Glencar blanket peatland, and comparisons of modelled NEEday with leaf area index (LAI) measurements verified the estimate of functional contribution using the separate slopes model. The significance of interannual variation (IAV) and functional responses on NEE at Glencar suggests that it is a resilient ecosystem which might be able to adapt to environmental or climatic changes, although given current climate change predictions, it is likely to have a reduced carbon dioxide sink status in the future.

abstract = {Emission of CO2, CH4 and N2O from the snowpack is an important component of annual C and N budgets in wetland ecosystems in mid- and high-latitude. However, there is little information about greenhouse gas fluxes during the snow-covered season in wetlands in Northeast China. In the present study, we investigated the trace gas fluxes from a peatland and a marsh using the methods of concentration gradient and diffusion model during the snow-covered season of 2010/2011 in this region. Estimates of CO2 efflux from a peatland and a marsh during this period were 4.179 and 5.026 g C m(-2) season(-1), respectively. The seasonal release of CH4 from the peatland (0.009 g C m(-2) season(-1)) was much lower than that from the marsh (0.818 g C m(-2) season(-1)). Intriguingly, we observed that the peatland acted as sink for N2O, and the marsh as a source for N2O during the snow-covered season. For the peatland, snowpack such as snow density is important for CO2 and CH4 fluxes, while N2O flux was controlled by soil-snow interface temperature. In the marsh, however, soil temperature was the primary parameter regulating greenhouse gas fluxes. Our results suggest that in mid- and high-latitude regions, greenhouse gas fluxes during the snow-covered season is an important part of C and N cycles in seasonally snow-covered wetland ecosystems. The difference in greenhouse gas emission from both peatland and marsh suggests that wetland types should be considered when evaluating regional gas budgets.

However, the use of the Bayesian approach is still limited in forest research, especially for models with many parameters. Some studies have used parameter screening to make the calibration of a computationally expensive model possible. In this paper we introduce a new methodology for parameter screening, based on canonical correlation analysis. Furthermore we show how parameter screening impacts the performance of a process-based model. The methodology presented here can be generally applied and is particularly suitable for complex process-based models because it is not computationally demanding and is easy to implement. It provides an overall ranking in relation to all outputs of the model, as opposed to common sensitivity methods that analyze one model output variable at a time. We found that parameter screening can be used to red...},

abstract = {Wetland ecosystems provide an optimum natural environment for the sequestration and long-term storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, yet are natural sources of greenhouse gases emissions, especially methane. We illustrate that most wetlands, when carbon sequestration is compared to methane emissions, do not have 25 times more CO2 sequestration than methane emissions; therefore, to many landscape managers and non specialists, most wetlands would be considered by some to be sources of climate warming or net radiative forcing. We show by dynamic modeling of carbon flux results from seven detailed studies by us of temperate and tropical wetlands and from 14 other wetland studies by others that methane emissions become unimportant within 300 years compared to carbon sequestration in wetlands. Within that time frame or less, most wetlands become both net carbon and radiative sinks. Furthermore, we estimate that the world's wetlands, despite being only about 5-8 {\%} of the terrestrial landscape, may currently be net carbon sinks of about 830 Tg/year of carbon with an average of 118 g-C m(-2) year(-1) of net carbon retention. Most of that carbon retention occurs in tropical/subtropical wetlands. We demonstrate that almost all wetlands are net radiative sinks when balancing carbon sequestration and methane emissions and conclude that wetlands can be created and restored to provide C sequestration and other ecosystem services without great concern of creating net radiative sources on the climate due to methane emissions.},

The system uses commercially available instrumentation: a three-axis sonic anemometer and an IR gas analyser which is used in a closed-path mode, i.e. air is brought to the optical bench by being ducted down a sampling tube from a point near the sonic anemometer. The system is controlled by specially written software which calculates the surface fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and carbon dioxide, and displays them in real time. The raw turbulent records can be stored for post-processing. Up to five additional analogue instruments can be sampled at up to 10 Hz and digitised by the sonic anemometer. The instruments are described and details of their operation and connection are presented. The system has relatively low power consumption and can operate from appropriate solar cells or rechargeable batteries. Calibration of the gas analyser needs to be performed typically every 2 or 3 days, and, given that the system requires minimal maintenance and is weather insensitive, it can be operated for the routine collection of surface flux data for extended periods. There are a number of corrections which have to be applied in any eddy covariance system and we describe the system of transfer functions which define our system. Some representative results showing the potential of the system are presented.},

The difference in maximum daily ET values (95th percentiles) between sites were greater in 2010 (3.14 mm d(-1) -4.17 mm d(-1)) compared to 2011 (3.68 mm d(-1) -3.95 mm d(-1)), yielding cumulative growing season ET that followed the wet to dry gradient in both 2010 and 2011. Synoptic weather conditions (i.e. air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and incoming solar radiation, etc.) could not explain differences in ET between sites due to their proximity to one another. Peat surface wetness was more spatially homogeneous at the wet site due to small average microtopographic variations (0.15 m) compared to the intermediate (0.30 m) and dry (0.41 m) sites. Although average Bowen ratios were less than one at all three sites, greater surface wetness and heating at the wettest site lead to differences in energy partitioning, with higher average Bowen ratios at the sites with a shallow average WTD. No significant relation between normalized ET and WTD was found at any of the sites that were consistent across both study years. In addition, the lack of a relation between ET and near-surface moisture suggests that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the boundary layer resistance created by the vascular canopy combined with low surface roughness limits evaporative losses from the peat surface. This study suggests that the low ET of a dry site compared to a wet site may be due to the impact of a long-term change in WTD on leaf area and the relative distribution of plant functional groups.

abstract = {Winter respiration in snow-covered ecosystems strongly influences annual carbon cycling, underlining the importance of processes related to the timing and quantity of snow. Fences were used to increase snow depth from 30 to 150 cm, and impacts on respiration were investigated in heath and mesic meadow, two common vegetation types in Svalbard. We manually measured ecosystem respiration from July 2007 to July 2008 at a temporal resolution greater than previously achieved in the High Arctic (campaigns: summer, eight; autumn, six; winter, 17; spring, nine). Moisture contents of unfrozen soil and soil temperatures throughout the year were also recorded. The increased snow depth resulted in significantly higher winter soil temperatures and increased ecosystem respiration. A temperature–efflux model explained most of the variation of observed effluxes: meadows, 94 (controls) and 93{\%} (fences); heaths, 84 and 77{\%}, respectively. Snow fences increased the total non-growing season efflux from 70 to 92 (heaths) and from 68 to 125 g CO2-C m-2 (meadows). The non-growing season contributed to 56 (heaths) and 42{\%} (meadows) of the total annual carbon respired. This proportion increased with deeper snow to 64{\%} in both vegetation types. Summer respiration rates were unaffected by snow fences, but the total growing season respiration was lower behind fences because of the considerably delayed snowmelt. Meadows had higher summer respiration rates than heaths. In addition, non-steady state CO2 effluxes were measured as bursts lasting several days during spring soil thawing, and when ice layers were broken to carry out winter efflux measurements.},

abstract = {A computational model is a representation of some physical or other system of interest, first expressed mathematically and then implemented in the form of a computer program; it may be viewed as a function of inputs that, when evaluated, produces outputs. Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

abstract = {Measurements of eddy fluxes are premised on the assumption that wind velocities are measured accurately by an ultrasonic anemometer. Recently, Gill ultrasonic anemometers have been shown to suffer errors depending on the angle of attack, which is the angle between the wind vector and the horizontal. The correction of these errors results in general eddy flux increases. However, since calibration for error dependent on angle of attack was carried out in a wind tunnel experiment under conditions of nearly laminar flow, the applicability of this correction to the field data under turbulent conditions has been questioned. In this study, angle of attack errors from a Gill WindMaster ultrasonic anemometer were assessed by field experiment, over meadow and under turbulent conditions. By using five identical anemometers, two configurations were evaluated: two pairs of anemometers for reference and one between the pairs for tilt. The dependence of anemometer (co)sine response on 0 to -90 degrees angles of attack in 10 degrees steps and at 45 degrees were checked. It was clarified that errors dependent on angle of attack occur even under turbulent conditions, with results similar to the wind tunnel experiments. Sine responses of vertical wind velocities here depended not only on vertical angle of attack but also on horizontal wind direction, a dynamic not considered in previous studies. For a more robust correction, alternative calibration functions were obtained empirically, so as to reasonably explain our field experimental results. Applying this new correction, eddy fluxes increased substantially even over meadow, which is somewhat aerodynamically smooth compared with forests or agricultural fields. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Effectiveness of a subsurface drainage system decreases with time, leading to a need to restore the drainage efficiency by installing new drain pipes in problem areas. The drainage performance of the resulting system varies spatially and complicates runoff and nutrient load generation within the fields. We presented a method to estimate the drainage performance of a heterogeneous subsurface drainage system by simulating the area with the three-dimensional hydrological FLUSH model. A GIS analysis was used to delineate the surface runoff contributing area in the field. We applied the method to reproduce the water balance and to investigate the effectiveness of a subsurface drainage network of a clayey field located in southern Finland. The subsurface drainage system was originally installed in the area in 1971 and the drainage efficiency was improved in 1995 and 2005 by installing new drains. FLUSH was calibrated against total runoff and drain discharge data from 2010 to 2011 and validated against total runoff in 2012. The model supported quantification of runoff fractions via the three installed drainage networks. Model realisations were produced to investigate the extent of the runoff contributing areas and the effect of the drainage parameters on subsurface drain discharge. The analysis showed that better model performance was achieved when the efficiency of the oldest drainage network (installed in 1971) was decreased. Our analysis method can reveal the drainage system performance but not the reason for the deterioration of the drainage performance. Tillage layer runoff from the field was originally computed by subtracting drain discharge from the total runoff. The drains installed in 1995 bypass the measurement system, which renders the tillage layer runoff calculation procedure invalid after 1995. Therefore, this article suggests use of a local correction coefficient based on the simulations for further research utilizing data from the study area.},

abstract = {Responses of stomatal conductance (gs) to increasing vapour pressure deficit (D) generally follow an exponential decrease described equally well by several empirical func- tions. However, the magnitude of the decrease – the stom- atal sensitivity – varies considerably both within and between species. Here we analysed data from a variety of sources employing both porometric and sap flux estimates of gs to evaluate the hypothesis that stomatal sensitivity is proportional to the magnitude of gs at low D ({\pounds} 1kPa). To test this relationship we used the function gs = gsref – m{\textperiodcentered}lnD where m is the stomatal sensitivity and gsref = gs at D = 1 kPa. Regardless of species or methodology, m was highly correlated with gsref (average r2 = 0{\textperiodcentered}75) with a slope of approximately 0{\textperiodcentered}6. We demonstrate that this empirical slope is consistent with the theoretical slope derived from a simple hydraulic model that assumes stomatal regulation of leaf water potential. The theoretical slope is robust to deviations from underlying assumptions and variation in model parameters. The relationships within and among species are close to theoretical predictions, regardless of whether the analysis is based on porometric measurements of gs in relation to leaf-surface D (Ds), or on sap flux-based stomatal conductance of whole trees (GSi), or stand-level stomatal conductance (GS) in relation to D. Thus, individ- uals, species, and stands with high stomatal conductance at low D show a greater sensitivity to D, as required by the role of stomata in regulating leaf water potential.},

abstract = {Accurate inventory of tropical peatland is important in order to (a) determine the magnitude of the carbon pool; (b) estimate the scale of transfers of peat-derived greenhouse gases to the atmosphere resulting from land use change; and (c) support carbon emissions reduction policies. We review available information on tropical peatland area and thickness and calculate peat volume and carbon content in order to determine their best estimates and ranges of variation. Our best estimate of tropical peatland area is 441 025 km2 (∼11{\%} of global peatland area) of which 247 778 km2 (56{\%}) is in Southeast Asia. We estimate the volume of tropical peat to be 1758 Gm3 (∼18–25{\%} of global peat volume) with 1359 Gm3 in Southeast Asia (77{\%} of all tropical peat). This new assessment reveals a larger tropical peatland carbon pool than previous estimates, with a best estimate of 88.6 Gt (range 81.7–91.9 Gt) equal to 15–19{\%} of the global peat carbon pool. Of this, 68.5 Gt (77{\%}) is in Southeast Asia, equal to 11–14{\%} of global peat carbon. A single country, Indonesia, has the largest share of tropical peat carbon (57.4 Gt, 65{\%}), followed by Malaysia (9.1 Gt, 10{\%}). These data are used to provide revised estimates for Indonesian and Malaysian forest soil carbon pools of 77 and 15 Gt, respectively, and total forest carbon pools (biomass plus soil) of 97 and 19 Gt. Peat carbon contributes 60{\%} to the total forest soil carbon pool in Malaysia and 74{\%} in Indonesia. These results emphasize the prominent global and regional roles played by the tropical peat carbon pool and the importance of including this pool in national and regional assessments of terrestrial carbon stocks and the prediction of peat-derived greenhouse gas emissions.},

abstract = {Eddy covariance technique to measure CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, water and energy fluxes between biosphere and atmosphere is widely spread and used in various regional networks. Currently more than 250 eddy covariance sites are active around the world measuring carbon exchange at high temporal resolution for different biomes and climatic conditions. In this paper a new standardized set of corrections is introduced and the uncertainties associated with these corrections are assessed for eight different forest sites in Europe with a total of 12 yearly datasets. The uncertainties introduced on the two components GPP (Gross Primary Production) and TER (Terrestrial Ecosystem Respiration) are also discussed and a quantitative analysis presented. Through a factorial analysis we find that generally, uncertainties by different corrections are additive without interactions and that the heuristic u{\textless}sub{\textgreater}*{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}-correction introduces the largest uncertainty. The results show that a standardized data processing is needed for an effective comparison across biomes and for underpinning inter-annual variability. The methodology presented in this paper has also been integrated in the European database of the eddy covariance measurements.},

abstract = {Peatlands are widely developed in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but little is known about carbon budgets for these alpine peatland ecosystems. In this study, we used an automatic chamber system to measure ecosystem respiration in the Hongyuan peatland, which is located in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Annual ecosystem respiration measurements showed a typical seasonal pattern, with the peak appearing in June. The highest respiration was 10.43 $\mu$mol CO2/m(2)/s, and the lowest was 0.20 $\mu$mol CO2/m(2)/s. The annual average ecosystem respiration was 2.06 $\mu$mol CO2/m(2)/s. The total annual respiration was 599.98 g C/m(2), and respiration during the growing season (from May to September) accounted for 78 {\%} of the annual sum. Nonlinear regression revealed that ecosystem respiration has a significant exponential correlation with soil temperature at 10-cm depth (R (2) = 0.98). The Q 10 value was 3.90, which is far higher than the average Q 10 value of terrestrial ecosystems. Ecosystem respiration had an apparent diurnal variation pattern in growing season, with peaks and valleys appearing at approximately 14:00 and 10:00, respectively, which could be explained by soil temperature and soil water content variation at 10-cm depth.},

abstract = {Significant climate risks are associated with a positive carbon-temperature feedback in northern latitude carbon-rich ecosystems, making an accurate analysis of human impacts on the net greenhouse gas balance of wetlands a priority. Here, we provide a coherent assessment of the climate footprint of a network of wetland sites based on simultaneous and quasi-continuous ecosystem observations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Experimental areas are located both in natural and in managed wetlands and cover a wide range of climatic regions, ecosystem types, and management practices. Based on direct observations we predict that sustained CH4 emissions in natural ecosystems are in the long term (i.e., several centuries) typically offset by CO2 uptake, although with large spatiotemporal variability. Using a space-for-time analogy across ecological and climatic gradients, we represent the chronosequence from natural to managed conditions to quantify the "cost" of CH4 emissions for the benefit of net carbon sequestration. With a sustained pulse-response radiative forcing model, we found a significant increase in atmospheric forcing due to land management, in particular for wetland converted to cropland. Our results quantify the role of human activities on the climate footprint of northern wetlands and call for development of active mitigation strategies for managed wetlands and new guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) accounting for both sustained CH4 emissions and cumulative CO2 exchange.},

abstract = {Measured surface-atmosphere fluxes of energy (sensible heat, H, and latent heat, LE) and CO2 (FCO2) represent the “true” flux plus or minus potential random and systematic measurement errors. Here, we use data from seven sites in the AmeriFlux network, including five forested sites (two of which include “tall tower” instrumentation), one grassland site, and one agricultural site, to conduct a cross-site analysis of random flux error. Quantification of this uncertainty is a prerequisite to model-data synthesis (data assimilation) and for defining confidence intervals on annual sums of net ecosystem exchange or making statistically valid comparisons between measurements and model predictions. We differenced paired observations (separated by exactly 24h, under similar environmental conditions) to infer the characteristics of the random error in measured fluxes. Random flux error more closely follows a double-exponential (Laplace), rather than a normal (Gaussian), distribution, and increase as a linear function of the magnitude of the flux for all three scalar fluxes. Across sites, variation in the random error follows consistent and robust patterns in relation to environmental variables. For example, seasonal differences in the random error for H are small, in contrast to both LE and FCO2, for which the random errors are roughly three-fold larger at the peak of the growing season compared to the dormant season. Random errors also generally scale with Rn (H and LE) and PPFD (FCO2). For FCO2 (but not H or LE), the random error decreases with increasing wind speed. Data from two sites suggest that FCO2 random error may be slightly smaller when a closed-path, rather than open-path, gas analyzer is used.},

abstract = {Information about the uncertainties associated with eddy covariance measurements of surface–atmosphere CO2 exchange is needed for data assimilation and inverse analyses to estimate model parameters, validation of ecosystem models against flux data, as well as multi-site synthesis activities (e.g., regional to continental integration) and policy decision-making. While model residuals (mismatch between fitted model predictions and measured fluxes) can potentially be analyzed to infer data uncertainties, the resulting uncertainty estimates may be sensitive to the particular model chosen. Here we use 10 site-years of data from the CarboEurope program, and compare the statistical properties of the inferred random flux measurement error calculated first using residuals from five different models, and secondly using paired observations made under similar environmental conditions. Spectral analysis of the model predictions indicated greater persistence (i.e., autocorrelation or “memory”) compared to the measured values. Model residuals exhibited weaker temporal correlation, but were not uncorrelated white noise. Random flux measurement uncertainty, expressed as a standard deviation, was found to vary predictably in relation to the expected magnitude of the flux, in a manner that was nearly identical (for negative, but not positive, fluxes) to that reported previously for forested sites. Uncertainty estimates were generally comparable whether the uncertainty was inferred from model residuals or paired observations, although the latter approach resulted in somewhat smaller estimates. Higher order moments (e.g., skewness and kurtosis) suggested that for fluxes close to zero, the measurement error is commonly skewed and leptokurtic. Skewness could not be evaluated using the paired observation approach, because differencing of paired measurements resulted in a symmetric distribution of the inferred error. Patterns were robust and not especially sensitive to the model used, although more flexible models, which did not impose a particular functional form on relationships between environmental drivers and modeled fluxes, appeared to give the best results. We conclude that evaluation of flux measurement errors from model residuals is a viable alternative to the standard paired observation approach.},

@article{Rigon2006,
abstract = {This paper describes a new distributed hydrological model, called GEOtop. The model accommodates very complex topography and, besides the water balance, unlike most other hydrological models, integrates all the terms in the surface energy balance equation. GEOtop uses a discretization of the landscape based on digital elevation data. These digital elevation data are preprocessed to allow modeling of the effect of topography on the radiation incident on the surface, both shortwave ( including shadowing) and longwave ( accounting for the sky view factor). For saturated and unsaturated subsurface flow, GEOtop makes use of a numerical solution of the 3D Richards' equation in order to properly model, besides the lateral flow, the vertical structure of water content and the suction dynamics. These characteristics are deemed necessary for consistently modeling hillslope processes, initiation of landslides, snowmelt processes, and ecohydrological phenomena as well as discharges during floods and interstorm periods. An accurate treatment of radiation inputs is implemented in order to be able to return surface temperature. The motivation behind the model is to combine the strengths and overcome the weaknesses of flood forecasting and land surface models. The former often include detailed spatial description and lateral fluxes but usually lack appropriate knowledge of the vertical ones. The latter are focused on vertical structure and usually lack spatial structure and prediction of lateral fluxes. Outlines of the processes simulated and the methods used to simulate them are given. A series of applications of the model to the Little Washita basin of Oklahoma using data from the Southern Great Plains 1997 Hydrology Experiment ( SGP97) is presented. These show the model's ability to reproduce the pointwise energy and water balance, showing that just an elementary calibration of a few parameters is needed for an acceptable reproduction of discharge at the outlet, for the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil moisture content, and for the simulation of a full year's streamflow without additional calibration.},

abstract = {The northern wetlands are one of the major sources of methane into the atmosphere. We measured annual methane emission from a boreal minerotrophic fen, Siikaneva, by the eddy covariance method. The average wintertime emissions were below 1 mg m -2  h -1 , and the summertime emissions about 3.5 mg m -2  h -1 . The water table depth did have any clear effect on methane emissions. During most of the year the emission depended on the temperature of peat below the water table. However, during the high and late summer the emission was independent on peat temperature as well. No diurnal cycle of methane flux was found. The total annual emission from the Siikaneva site was 12.6 g m -2 . The emissions of the snow free period contributed 91{\%} to the annual emission. The emission pulse during the snow melting period was clearly detectable but of minor importance adding only less than 3{\%} to the annual emission. Over 20{\%} of the carbon assimilated during the year as carbon dioxide was emitted as methane. Thus methane emission is an important component of the carbon balance of the Siikaneva fen. This indicates need of taking methane into account when studying carbon balances of northern fen ecosystems.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0889.2007.00261.x},

abstract = {Grasslands cover about 40{\%} of the ice-free global terrestrial surface, but their quantitative importance in global carbon exchange with the atmosphere is still highly uncertain, and thus their potential for carbon sequestration remains speculative. Here, we report on CO2 exchange of an extensively used mountain hay meadow and pasture in the Swiss pre-Alps on high-organic soils (7-45{\%} C by mass) over a 3-year period (18 May 2002-20 September 2005), including the European summer 2003 heat-wave period. During all 3 years, the ecosystem was a net source of CO2 (116-256 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Harvests and grazing cows (mostly via C export in milk) further increased these C losses, which were estimated at 355 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2003 (95{\%} confidence interval 257-454 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Although annual carbon losses varied considerably among years, the CO2 budget during summer 2003 was not very different from the other two summers. However, and much more importantly, the winter that followed the warm summer of 2003 observed a significantly higher carbon loss when there was snow (133 +/- 6 g C m(-2)) than under comparable conditions during the other two winters (73 +/- 5 and 70 +/- 4 g C m(-2), respectively). The continued annual C losses can most likely be attributed to the long-term effects of drainage and peat exploitation that began 119 years ago, with the last significant drainage activities during the Second World War around 1940. The most realistic estimate based on depth profiles of ash content after combustion suggests that there is an 500-910 g C m(-2) yr(-1) loss associated with the decomposition of organic matter. Our results clearly suggest that putting efforts into preserving still existing carbon stocks may be more successful than attempts to increase sequestration rates in such high-organic mountain grassland soils.},

abstract = {Northern peatlands contain up to 25{\%} of the world's soil carbon (C) and have an estimated annual exchange of CO2-C with the atmosphere of 0.1–0.5 Pg yr1 and of CH4-C of 10–25 Tg yr1. Despite this overall importance to the global C cycle, there have been few, if any, complete multiyear annual C balances for these ecosystems. We report a 6-year balance computed from continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), regular instantaneous measurements of methane (CH4) emissions, and export of dissolved organic C (DOC) from a northern ombrotrophic bog. From these observations, we have constructed complete seasonal and annual C balances, examined their seasonal and interannual variability, and compared the mean 6-year contemporary C exchange with the apparent C accumulation for the last 3000 years obtained from C density and agedepth profiles from two peat cores. The 6-year mean NEE-C and CH4-C exchange, and net DOC loss are 40.2  40.5 ( 1 SD), 3.7  0.5, and 14.9  3.1 gm2 yr1, giving a 6-year mean balance of 21.5  39.0 gm2 yr1 (where positive exchange is a loss of C from the ecosystem). NEE had the largest magnitude and variability of the components of the C balance, but DOC and CH4 had similar proportional variabilities and their inclusion is essential to resolve the C balance. There are large interseasonal and interannual ranges to the exchanges due to variations in climatic conditions. We estimate from the largest and smallest seasonal exchanges, quasi-maximum limits of the annual C balance between 50 and 105 gm2 yr1. The net C accumulation rate obtained from the two peatland cores for the interval 400–3000 BP (samples from the anoxic layer only) were 21.9  2.8 and 14.0  37.6 gm2 yr1, which are not significantly different from the 6-year mean contemporary exchange.},

In particular, it emphasizes on determining whether the relationship for a closed canopy is linear, consistent with the Monteith model, or curvilinear, consistent with the results of many mechanistic canopy models. Both general relationships and relationships for different vegetation classes are sought. Some methodology-related differences are also investigated, including comparison between micrometeorological and enclosure methods, the effect of taking into account respiration rate, and the effect of integrating measurements in time. For this, statistics are used on similar data sets, that is, except for the variable under study, all environmental conditions are similar, and the data are obtained on the same site, with the same measuring technique, by the same scientific team, and statistics on grouped data sets, that is, all the data sets on closed canopies satisfying the conditions described in the data analysis section are grouped by vegetation class or method of measurement or representation.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to estimate annual CH4 efflux from wetlands and watercourses in Europe and some adjacent areas. Wet ecosystems were divided into seven categories: ombrotrophic mires, minerotrophic mires, freshwater marshes, saltwater marshes, small lakes, large lakes and rivers. The geographical distribution and total area coverage for each of these respective ecosystems were taken from CORINE 2000, Global Land Cover 2000 [JRC, 2003. Harmonisation, mosaicing and production of the Global Land Cover 2000 database (Beta Version). EUR 20849 EN, Joint Research Center, Ispra, Italy] and ESRI 2003 databases. CH4 release factors were obtained from an extensive overview of published literature. Less than 3{\%} of the study area of 22,560,000km2 consisted of wetlands and watercourses. Large lakes (40{\%}), minerotrophic mires (24{\%}) and ombrotrophic mires (20{\%}) covered almost 85{\%} of the total area of wetlands and watercourses. The total CH4 release from European wetlands and watercourses was estimated to be 5.2Tga−1. CH4 release from minerotrophic mires (48{\%}), large lakes (24{\%}), and ombrotrophic mires (12{\%}) composed most of the total CH4 efflux. High variation in the rate of CH4 release within the main ecosystem types, small number of studies in some ecosystems and ecologically inadequate land-cover classification are the main reasons for the uncertainties of the estimate. A better estimation of European CH4 effluxes from natural sources, now and future, would require: a much more detailed and ecologically relevant mapping of the area of different types of wetlands and watercourses, and long-term measurements of CH4 fluxes and their controlling environmental factors in poorly studied types of wetlands and watercourses. Finally, the data could be used for dynamic modelling of CH4 fluxes in the current and changing environmental conditions.},

Linking hyperspectral remote sensing with carbon fluxes and biophysical parameters is critical to allow the exploitation of spatial and temporal extensive information for validating model simulations at different scales. In this study, we present the WhiteRef, a new hyperspectral system designed as a direct result of the needs identified during the EUROSPEC ES0903 Cost Action, and developed by Fondazione Edmund Mach and the Institute of Biometeorology, CNR, Italy. The system is based on the ASD FieldSpec Pro spectroradiometer and was designed to acquire continuous radiometric measurements at the Eddy Covariance (EC) towers and to fill a gap in the scientific community: in fact, no system for continuous spectral measurements in the Short Wave Infrared was tested before at the EC sites. The paper illustrates the functioning of the WhiteRef and describes its main advantages and disadvantages. The WhiteRef system, being based on a robust and high quality commercially available instrument, has a clear potential for unattended continuous measurements aiming at the validation of satellites' vegetation products.},

abstract = {Permafrost soils in boreal and Arctic ecosystems store almost twice as much carbon as is currently present in the atmosphere. Permafrost thaw and the microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon is considered one of the most likely positive climate feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world. The rate of carbon release from permafrost soils is highly uncertain, but it is crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon-cycle feedback effect, and thus how important permafrost thaw will be for climate change this century and beyond. Sustained transfers of carbon to the atmosphere that could cause a significant positive feedback to climate change must come from old carbon, which forms the bulk of the permafrost carbon pool that accumulated over thousands of years. Here we measure net ecosystem carbon exchange and the radiocarbon age of ecosystem respiration in a tundra landscape undergoing permafrost thaw to determine the influence of old carbon loss on ecosystem carbon balance. We find that areas that thawed over the past 15 years had 40 per cent more annual losses of old carbon than minimally thawed areas, but had overall net ecosystem carbon uptake as increased plant growth offset these losses. In contrast, areas that thawed decades earlier lost even more old carbon, a 78 per cent increase over minimally thawed areas; this old carbon loss contributed to overall net ecosystem carbon release despite increased plant growth. Our data document significant losses of soil carbon with permafrost thaw that, over decadal timescales, overwhelms increased plant carbon uptake at rates that could make permafrost a large biospheric carbon source in a warmer world.},

abstract = {The rising export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peatlands during the last 20 years is of great environmental concern, as DOC harms drinking water quality and diminishes the carbon storage of peatlands. Lack of knowledge particularly exists for fens. The aim of our study was to determine DOC concentrations at an agriculturally used fen and a rewetted fen throughout the year. We measured DOC concentrations in ditch water of these fens in 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, discharge measurements were condcucted to detect DOC export. Overall DOC concentrations at our agriculturally used site and at our rewetted site were 35 mg L−1 and 26 mg L−1 (median), respectively. The maximum DOC concentration at our agriculturally used site was twice as high as at the rewetted site (134 mg L−1 vs. 61 mg L−1). Annual DOC export was calculated for the rewetted site, amounting to 200 kg C ha−1 on average. Our results suggest that rewetting of degraded fens reduces DOC export in the long-term, while agricultural use of fens leads to enhanced decomposition and thus, elevates DOC export.},

@article{Seok2009,
abstract = {An experimental system for sampling trace gas fluxes through seasonal snowpack was deployed at a subalpine site near treeline at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. The sampling manifold was in place throughout the entire snow-covered season for continuous air sampling with minimal disturbance to the snowpack. A series of gases (carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, ozone, volatile organic compounds) was determined in interstitial air withdrawn at eight heights in and above the snowpack at similar to hourly intervals. In this paper, carbon dioxide data from 2007 were used for evaluation of this technique. Ancillary data recorded inlcuded snow physical properties, i.e., temperature, pressure, and density. Various vertical concentration gradients were determined from the multiple height measurements, which allowed calculation of vertical gas fluxes through the snowpack using Fick's 1st law of diffusion. Comparison of flux results obtained from different height inlet combinations show that under most conditions fluxes derived from individual gradient intervals agree with the overall median of all data within a factor of 1.5. Winds were found to significantly influence gas concentration and gradients in the snowpack. Under the highest observed wind conditions, concentration gradients and calculated fluxes dropped to as low as 13{\%} of non-wind conditions. Measured differential pressure amplitude exhibited a linear relationship with wind speed. This suggests that wind speed is a sound proxy for assessing advection transport in the snow. Neglecting the wind-pumping effect resulted in considerable underestimation of gas fluxes. An analysis of dependency of fluxes on wind speeds during a 3-week period in mid-winter determined that over this period actual gas fluxes were most likely 57{\%} higher than fluxes calculated by the diffusion method, which omits the wind pumping dependency.},

abstract = {The EMEP MSC-W Eulerian chemical transport model is used to investigate a number of features concerning the concentrations and depositions of reactive nitrogen species over Europe, with a focus on forest ecosystems and soil emissions. We illustrate the relative contributions of oxidised versus reduced nitrogen, and of dry versus wet deposition, to nitrogen inputs to forests. A comparison with measurements, including data for the NOFRETETE sites, showed that the EMEP model performs generally well for N-compounds, although with some problems for NH3 which is difficult to model with a large-scale model. The model was modified to make use of a new forest-soil–NO inventory (with daily resolution) from the NOFRETETE project and used to calculate the potential effects of these emissions on N-deposition to forests, and on the ozone-indicator AOT40. The contribution of soil–NO to these environmental measures was found to be generally small, but significant in some areas, with changes ranging between 0–20{\%} in Central Europe and even greater in Scandinavia. Given the large uncertainties in soil–NO emission estimates, it is clear that this source is potentially comparable in its importance to many combustion sources in parts of Europe, and deserves more attention.},

abstract = {Northern peatlands contain an estimated 1/3 of the world's soil carbon pool. This large carbon pool is of concern due to its uncertain future in a changing climate. Blanket bogs are peatlands that occur in temperate maritime regions where precipitation is much greater than evapotranspiration. We describe five years (1 October 2002 to 30 September 2007) of eddy-covariance (EC) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements in an Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland. The measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was partitioned into its components of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross ecosystem production (GEP). The inter-annual variation of the CO2 fluxes was investigated using correlation coefficient analyses with measured hydro-meteorological parameters. The annual NEE was negative for all five years (thus the peatland was a sink of CO2), ranging between −16.5±5.1 and −96.5±23.2gC-CO2m−2 (average of −54.9±15.6gC-CO2m−2). During the study period, NEE was negative for the same five months in each year (May–September). NEE showed the highest CO2 uptake (due to the highest GEP) in the summer with intermediate rather than extreme meteorological conditions, thus with low vapour pressure deficit, intermediate soil water content, air temperature and light radiation, which might be partly explained by the role of the bryophyte community. Under climate change predictions of higher temperature, the inter-annual variation analysis suggests that ER might increase in winter. Furthermore, the predicted lower precipitation and higher temperature in the summer are expected to lead to lower GEP. The resulting increase in NEE (thus lower CO2 uptake) will be partly compensated by a higher GEP in warmer winters and in dryer autumns. Moreover, the CO2 uptake will benefit by a longer growing season, while wetter conditions will likely lower the ecosystem respiration in the spring. The length of the growing season was found to be driven by warmer winter and September soil temperatures.},

abstract = {Water and energy fluxes control the development of northern peatlands and influence their carbon budget. Blanket bogs are peatlands that occur in temperate maritime regions where precipitation is much greater than evapotranspiration (ET). In this paper, five years (October 2002-September 2007) of ET and energy fluxes derived from eddy-covariance measurements were analyzed in the context of the predicted climate change for Ireland. Monthly ET at the Glencar Atlantic blanket bog varied little, ranging between a minimum of 12 mm month(-1) and a maximum of 56 mm month-1 over the five years, resulting in an annual ET average of 394 mm, with typical highest daily values of 2.5-3.0 mm. Compared to other peatland types, Glencar had lower summer ET and a lower ET/potential ET ratio, despite having higher precipitation and water table. The ET was limited not only by the low vapor pressure deficit and cool summer temperatures but also by the low cover of vascular plants and mosses (essential for transpiration). The energy budget was similar to other peatland types in terms of net radiation and sensible heat fluxes, but had lower latent and higher ground heat fluxes. A comparison among the five years suggests that the predicted climate change (greater winter precipitation, lower summer precipitation, and higher all year round temperatures) will probably increase winter ET, while the summer energy flux patterns will not be profoundly affected. However, if the frequency of summer rain events should diminish, the moss component of these ecosystems may become water stressed, ultimately leading to lower evapotranspiration.},

abstract = {We developed the McGill Wetland Model (MWM) based on the general structure of the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS) and the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model. Three major changes were made to PCARS: (1) the light use efficiency model of photosynthesis was replaced with a biogeochemical description of photosynthesis; (2) the description of autotrophic respiration was changed to be consistent with the formulation of photosynthesis; and (3) the cohort, multilayer soil respiration model was changed to a simple one box peat decomposition model divided into an oxic and anoxic zones by an effective water table, and a one-year residence time litter pool. MWM was then evaluated by comparing its output to the estimates of net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) from 8 years of continuous measurements at the Mer Bleue peatland, a raised ombrotrophic bog located in southern Ontario, Canada (index of agreement [dimensionless]: NEP = 0.80, GPP = 0.97, ER = 0.97; systematic RMSE [gCm(-2) d(-1)]: NEP = 0.12, GPP = 0.07, ER = 0.14; unsystematic RMSE: NEP = 0.15, GPP = 0.27, ER = 0.23). Simulated moss NPP approximates what would be expected for a bog peatland, but shrub NPP appears to be underestimated. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the model output did not change greatly due to variations in water table because of offsetting responses in production and respiration, but that even a modest temperature increase could lead to converting the bog from a sink to a source of CO2. General weaknesses and further developments of MWM are discussed.},

abstract = {Southern Appalachian Mountain wetlands support important habitat and serve several hydrologic functions. However, they may be threatened by human activities and global climate change. These wetlands are often located in remote, biogeographically isolated locations at high elevations. One of the largest of these wetlands the peatlands within the Cranberry Glades Botanical Area was assessed for meadow-forest ecotone characteristics. The Cranberry Glades have been reported to be infilling with trees from the surrounding forest, but little research has been conducted on the patterns of tree growth within the moss-dominated communities. Tree establishment patterns were analyzed in regard to location within the ecotone, hummock/hollow topography, and soil conditions by recording the growing conditions of 1389 trees located within nine, 10 x 100 m belt transects. The results indicated that tree growth within the ecotone occurred in decreasing density from the forest to the meadow interior, and much of the tree establishment occurred in tree islands (80{\%} of trees were found in tree islands). Significantly more trees (92{\%}) were also found on hummocks than hollows (8{\%}), likely in response to the greater distance from the water table that the hummocks provide. Most soil properties did not vary significantly across the ecotone or in association with topography. The results add to the minimal literature on southern peatlands and may assist in peatland restoration and conservation efforts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Peatlands are large sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream ecosystems and DOC losses account for an important portion of peatland carbon balance. Disturbance and restoration of peatland ecosystems alters ecohydrological conditions that are likely to affect DOC chemistry in both soil water and discharge, although the direction of change and controls on DOC chemistry post-restoration remain unclear. We investigated DOC chemistry (concentration, SUVA254, E2:E3, E4:E6, pentose and hexose concentration) during the growing season (May to October) in soil and discharge of a peatland restored for 10 years and compared the results to those measured at neighbouring unrestored and natural peatland sites. Controls on the spatial and temporal variability of DOC chemistry, including pH, water table, temperature, plant cover and type, and carbon dioxide and methane flux were also investigated. After 10 years, restoration increased DOC concentration in soils compared to both natural and unrestored sites. This high DOC concentration likely resulted from high plant productivity post-restoration and a mean water table position deeper than the natural site. Ecohydrological conditions were also correlated to DOC chemistry. High vascular plant cover and photosynthesis rates were correlated to lower SUVA254 and higher pentose concentration, while deeper water table position was correlated to higher E2:E3 and E4:E6. DOC concentration in discharge was lower, and E2:E3 higher, at the restored compared to the unrestored site. Differences in DOC chemistry in discharge water were minimal between the sites except when water was likely sourced from the near surface layer at the restored site, which represents new peat accumulated post-restoration. These results suggest that DOC dynamics 10 years post-restoration remain intermediate between natural and unrestored peatland.},

abstract = {1.Hydrological changes due to drainage and climate warming can have great impact on the ecosystem balance of boreal mires. The possibility of ombrotrophication, i.e. the development from fen to bog, in response to altered hydrology has not been previously tested. Here, recent changes in vegetation and surface peat are studied in an aapa mire, a typical boreal mire system dominated by fen vegetation. Drainage in the catchment from 1968 onwards led to the change from richly minerogenous to ombrogenous hydrology, thus providing a long-term ombrotrophication experiment. 2.A sequence of aerial photographs (1941, 1953, 1965, 1974, 1984, 1995, 2005) revealed a dramatic shift from fen vegetation to the nearly complete dominance of peat mosses (Sphagnum) within two decades after the catchment disturbance. 3.A distinct change from Carex peat to Sphagnum peat at the average depth of 23.3 cm (SE 0.8 cm) was found in 18 peat cores. All of the new Sphagnum peat had accumulated within the last four decades. This was verified by the relationship of age and rooting depth of 37 small pines (Pinus sylvestris) and by two pollen density profiles. The ratio Ca/Mg diminished towards the surface of peat profiles indicating change from minerogenous to ombrogenous hydrology. In accordance, extremely low pH (range 3.8–4.2) and conductivity (average 14.5 $\mu$s cm−1) were measured in the surface pore water. 4.The average total dry mass of new Sphagnum peat was 7042 g m−2 (SE 442) and the recent apparent rate of carbon accumulation was 100.6 g m−2 year−1 (SE 6.3), as calculated for a 35-year period and 50{\%} carbon content. 5.Synthesis. Remarkable potential for vegetation change and increase of peat growth is demonstrated in boreal aapa mires. Ombrotrophication can be initiated within a few decades in response to reduced input of minerogenous water. Future changes in the hydrological cycle, as indicated by climate change models, are similar to the impact of catchment disturbance in aapa mires. Diminished total water budgets during the summer cause a decrease of minerogenous input and a draw-down of water level, both of which may promote the growth of Sphagnum over fen vegetation.},

Our results show a 10-fold increase in aboveground biomass between the reference site and the most severely drained site, resulting from the growth of a tree layer. The total leaf biomass increased slightly as a result of drainage, thus an increase in woody biomass was the main cause of the increase in aboveground biomass.

abstract = {Blanket mires extend over approximately 22,500 km2 of the north and west of the British Isles, and are of both national and international importance. Blanket peat started to form locally in some regions 9400 years ago, but the period of most active spread was between 5100 and 3100 BP. Clearance of forest and scrub by human activity probably triggered peat formation in many areas, though the influence of longer term changes in climate can be detected both in the times of peat initiation and in subsequent peat growth. High-quality blanket mires can be characterized by the presence of distinctive plant communities, well-defined microtopographic differentiation of the mire surface, and a diplotelmic structure to the peat mass. Many blanket mires, however, currently have a modified, damaged, or eroded vegetation cover. British and Irish blanket mires are used for a variety of purposes: year-round grazing (mainly sheep), game stocking (red grouse and red deer), water catchment, plantation forestry, domestic and commercial peat extraction, military training, recreation, and conservation. The associated management practices can have significant effects on the composition and structure of the vegetation, the bird and invertebrate faunas, and the physical and chemical properties of the underlying peat. A major part of the British blanket mire resource is affected and modified by grazing, burning, and drainage; only approximately 4000 km2 may remain in a near-natural state. An estimated 3500 km2 is afforested and a further 3500 km2 is eroded. Atmospheric pollution has been shown to have had significant effects on the blanket mire vegetation only in the Southern Pennines, but substantial areas in Wales, northern England, and southwestern Scotland are potentially at risk from high levels of sulphur and nitrogen deposition. The peat mass is very susceptible to erosion from natural agents: frost, drought, rain, and wind. However, erosion normally occurs only when the plant cover is damaged. Severely eroded peat is found in all blanket mire regions of the British Isles and is most common above 450 to 500 m altitude, where it is associated with the development of gully systems within the peat mass. Erosion has almost certainly increased in intensity in the last 200 years, as land-use pressures have intensified, but there is evidence from a number of regions that active gully systems were present by at least AD 1500-1700. Damage and erosion of the blanket mire vegetation has considerable economic and amenity consequences: loss of grazing land, infilling of reservoirs with sediment and periodic discolouration of water supplies, loss of distinctive wildlife (particularly birds), and impaired recreational value. Techniques are now available for the revegetation and restoration of badly damaged blanket mire, but they are very costly. Government schemes that provide incentives for less-intensive management of blanket mires offer a potentially more viable way of meeting our international conservation obligations},

abstract = {The chemical transformations that govern storage, degradation, and loss of organic matter in northern peatlands are poorly characterized, despite the significance of these peat deposits as pivotal reservoirs in the global carbon cycle. One of the most challenging problems concerns the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in peat porewaters, particularly higher-molecular weight compounds that may function either as non-reactive sinks or reactive intermediates for organic byproducts of microbial decay. The complexity of these large molecules has defied attempts to characterize their molecular structure in bulk samples with a high degree of precision. We therefore determined the composition and reactivity of DOM from representative bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) in northern Minnesota, USA. We applied four complementary techniques: electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitation–emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. We observed that the vast majority ({\textgreater}80{\%}) of molecular formulas that appear in the surface bog DOM are also present at 2.9m depth, indicating that much of DOM in the bog is resistant to microbial degradation. In contrast to bog samples, a considerable number of new compounds with low O/C and high H/C elemental ratios were observed in the 3m fen horizon relative to surface samples. These results indicate a more pronounced difference in the composition of surface and deep DOM in the fen. SUVA, determined at 254nm, indicated significantly lower aromaticity in deep fen samples relative to deep bog samples. This trend was verified by 1H NMR. Aromatic and carbohydrate components represented up to 70{\%} of deep bog DOM but comprised a much smaller proportion of deep fen DOM, which was dominated by functionalized and non-functionalized aliphatics. Molecular formula data determined by FT-ICR mass spectrometry were consistent with results from optical and NMR spectroscopy measurements and showed that compounds with low O/C and high H/C were generated with depth in the fen. Such compounds were absent in both surface fen and in surface and deep bog samples respectively, providing further evidence of qualitative and quantitative differences in the evolution of DOM in fens and bogs. These differences, attributed to either variations in source vegetation or environmental factors that render DOM more reactive in fen sites or less reactive in bog sites, have important implications for the response of peatlands to climate change, since climatic change leading to moister conditions may enhance the abundance of sedge-dominated fens and increase the pool of more labile soil carbon.},

abstract = {The evaporation regimes of two northern New Zealand raised peat bogs with vegetation dominated by the restionaceous rush Sporadanthus traversii were investigated. One of the bogs is unmodified while the other is affected by the drainage practices of surrounding agricultural land. Measurements of the latent heat flux obtained concurrently with Bowen ratio and eddy covariance techniques were in close agreement, and good energy balance closure was demonstrated when there was adequate fetch. Evaporation rates and energy partitioning behaviour were similar for the two bogs despite differences in water table elevation and peat moisture content. Evaporation rates averaged 2.9 mm day(-1), equivalent to 55{\%} of the equilibrium evaporation rate. Energy balance partitioning favoured the sensible heat flux, and Bowen ratios of around 2 were common. The importance of the latent heat flux in the energy balance depended on the state of canopy wetness following frequent rainfall events. When the canopy was completely wet, evaporation rates approximated, or exceeded, the equilibrium evaporation rate. Evaporation rates were evidently constrained by a combination of plant physiological and canopy structural factors which combined to prevent high rates of evaporation from the moist peat surface. These findings provide evidence of strong canopy-hydrological feedbacks within the raised peat bogs of northern New Zealand which result in conditions favourable for peat formation.

Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the two most important GHGs after carbon dioxide (CO2), but their regional and global budgets are not well known. In this study, we applied a process-based coupled biogeochemical model to concurrently estimate the magnitude and spatial and temporal patterns of CH4 and N2O fluxes as driven by multiple environmental changes, including climate variability, rising atmospheric CO2, increasing nitrogen deposition, tropospheric ozone pollution, land use change, and nitrogen fertilizer use. The estimated CH4 and N2O emissions from global land ecosystems during 1981–2010 were 144.39 ± 12.90 Tg C/yr (mean ± 2 SE; 1 Tg = 1012 g) and 12.52 ± 0.74 Tg N/yr, respectively. Our simulations indicated a significant (P {\textless} 0.01) annually increasing trend for CH4 (0.43 ± 0.06 Tg C/yr) and N2O (0.14 ± 0.02 Tg N/yr) in the study...},

abstract = {Methane (CH(4)) flux into the atmosphere during spring thaw was investigated in a small ombrotrophic peatland (141 degrees 48'E, 43 degrees 19'N, Japan) using the conventional chamber method. More than 50 chamber deployments on top of the snow cover were carried out and continued for more than 165h until the surface snow and underlying ice cover on top of the peat layer had thawed completely. Methane emissions were almost absent in the presence of snow cover. At the very moment the surface ice cover thawed, a large CH(4) flush ({\textgreater}10mgCH(4)m(-2)h(-1)) was recorded, which was on the same order of magnitude as episodic ebullition previously observed in the high-summer. Gas bubbles trapped in the ice layer on top of the waterlogged peat were preliminarily analyzed for the volumetric percentage in the total ice volume and their gas species compositions. Results showed that the bubbles occupied about 3.2{\%} volume and that the mixing ratio of CH(4) in the bubbles was about 20{\%}. The abundance of the bubble-form CH(4) was sufficient to explain the observed episodic CH(4) release during the thaw. Results of this study show that CH(4) emissions during the thaw season have great temporal variability; emission occurs as an episodic release of bubble-form CH(4) stored in the frozen layer. The results also imply the possibility that gas-phase CH(4) plays an important role, not only during the growing season but also in cold-season CH(4) dynamics in northern peatlands.},

abstract = {Wetlands are the largest natural source of atmospheric methane. Here, we assess controls on methane flux using a database of approximately 19 000 instantaneous measurements from 71 wetland sites located across subtropical, temperate, and northern high latitude regions. Our analyses confirm general controls on wetland methane emissions from soil temperature, water table, and vegetation, but also show that these relationships are modified depending on wetland type (bog, fen, or swamp), region (subarctic to temperate), and disturbance. Fen methane flux was more sensitive to vegetation and less sensitive to temperature than bog or swamp fluxes. The optimal water table for methane flux was consistently below the peat surface in bogs, close to the peat surface in poor fens, and above the peat surface in rich fens. However, the largest flux in bogs occurred when dry 30-day averaged antecedent conditions were followed by wet conditions, while in fens and swamps, the largest flux occurred when both 30-day averaged antecedent and current conditions were wet. Drained wetlands exhibited distinct characteristics, e.g. the absence of large flux following wet and warm conditions, suggesting that the same functional relationships between methane flux and environmental conditions cannot be used across pristine and disturbed wetlands. Together, our results suggest that water table and temperature are dominant controls on methane flux in pristine bogs and swamps, while other processes, such as vascular transport in pristine fens, have the potential to partially override the effect of these controls in other wetland types. Because wetland types vary in methane emissions and have distinct controls, these ecosystems need to be considered separately to yield reliable estimates of global wetland methane release.},

abstract = {We present a record of peatland development during the last 1000 years from Mauntschas mire in the eastern Swiss Alps (Upper Engadine valley; 1818 m a.s.l.) inferred from testate amoebae (pH and depth to the water table (DWT) reconstructions), stable oxygen isotopes in Sphagnum (??18O; proxy for water vapour pressure) and carbon isotopes in Sphagnum (??13C; proxy for mire surface wetness), peat accumulation rates, charcoal (indicating local burning), pollen and spores (proxies for human impact), and plant macrofossils (reflecting local vegetation and trophic state). Past human impact on the local mire conditions was strong but fluctuating during AD 1000-1570 (??50 yr; depth-age model based on 29 14C AMS dates) with local irrigation of nutrient-enriched water and grazing. Human impact was minor AD 1570-1830 (??30 yr) with partial recovery of the local mire vegetation, and it was absent AD 1830 (??30 yr)-present when hummock formation took place. Correlations among DWT, pH, ??13C, and ??18O, carried out both with the raw data and with linear trends removed, suggest that the factors driving peatland development changed over time, since only testate amoeba-based pH and DWT co-varied during all the three aforementioned periods. ??18O correlates with ??13C only in the period AD 1830-present and with DWT only during AD 1570-1830, ??13C correlates with DWT only during AD 1000-1570. Part of this apparent instability among the four time series might be attributed to shifts in the local mire conditions which potentially formed very different (non-analogue) habitats. Lack of analogues, caused, for example, by pre-industrial human impact, might have introduced artefacts in the reconstructions, since those habitats are not well represented in some proxy transfer functions. Human impact was probably the main factor for peatland development, distorting most of the climate signals. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Evaporation from wet canopies (E) can return up to half of incident rainfall back into the atmosphere and is a major cause of the difference in water use between forests and short vegetation. Canopy water budget measurements often suggest values of E during rainfall that are several times greater than those predicted from Penman–Monteith theory. Our literature review identified potential issues with both estimation approaches, producing several hypotheses that were tested using micrometeorological observations from 128 FLUXNET sites world-wide. The analysis shows that FLUXNET eddy-covariance measurements tend to provide unreliable measurements of E during rainfall. However, the other micrometeorological FLUXNET observations do provide clues as to why conventional Penman–Monteith applications underestimate E. Aerodynamic exchange rather than radiation often drives E during rainfall, and hence errors in air humidity measurement and aerodynamic conductance calculation have considerable impact. Furthermore, evaporative cooling promotes a downwards heat flux from the air aloft as well as from the biomass and soil; energy sources that are not always considered. Accounting for these factors leads to E estimates and modelled interception losses that are considerably higher. On the other hand, canopy water budget measurements can lead to overestimates of E due to spatial sampling errors in throughfall and stemflow, underestimation of canopy rainfall storage capacity, and incorrect calculation of rainfall duration. There are remaining questions relating to horizontal advection from nearby dry areas, infrequent large-scale turbulence under stable atmospheric conditions, and the possible mechanical removal of splash droplets by such eddies. These questions have implications for catchment hydrology, rainfall recycling, land surface modelling, and the interpretation of eddy-covariance measurements.},

abstract = {Natural peatlands are important carbon sinks and sources of methane (CH4). In contrast, drained peatlands turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source and potentially emit nitrous oxide (N2O). Rewetting of peatlands thus potentially implies climate change mitigation. However, data about the time span that is needed for the re-establishment of the carbon sink function by restoration are scarce. We therefore investigated the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of three differently vegetated sites of a bog ecosystem 30 years after rewetting. All three vegetation communities turned out to be sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) ranging between 0.6 ± 1.43 t CO2 ha−2 yr−1 (Sphagnum-dominated vegetation) and 3.09 ± 3.86 t CO2 ha−2 yr−1 (vegetation dominated by heath). While accounting for the different global warming potential (GWP) of CO2, CH4 and N2O, the annual GHG balance was calculated. Emissions ranged between 25 and 53 t CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1 and were dominated by large emissions of CH4 (22–51 t CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1), with highest rates found at purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) stands. These are to our knowledge the highest CH4 emissions so far reported for bog ecosystems in temperate Europe. As the restored area was subject to large fluctuations in the water table, we assume that the high CH4 emission rates were caused by a combination of both the temporal inundation of the easily decomposable plant litter of purple moor grass and the plant-mediated transport through its tissues. In addition, as a result of the land use history, mixed soil material due to peat extraction and refilling can serve as an explanation. With regards to the long time span passed since rewetting, we note that the initial increase in CH4 emissions due to rewetting as described in the literature is not inevitably limited to a short-term period.},

abstract = {A small body of research suggests that dissimilatory sulfate reduction can affect the carbon balance of peatlands, yet this has not been tested widely, despite the fact that peatlands contain approximately one-third of the global soil carbon pool. Here we evaluate the role of dissimilatory sulfate reduction in a site that receives low atmospheric sulfur deposition. We hypothesized that, in peatlands receiving low sulfate inputs, methane production should dominate anaerobic carbon mineralization. We further hypothesized that with sulfate amendments, anaerobic carbon mineralization could show an overall increase if terminal carbon mineralization in unamended peat is limited by an inadequate supply of electron acceptors. To test these hypotheses, we delineated six 1-m(2) plots in an ombrotrophic, boreal peatland in central Alberta, Canada (Bleak Lake Bog), which receives {\textless}2 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1). Three of the plots were amended with sulfate (78 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1)). We measured anaerobic rates of sulfate reduction, CH4 production, and CO2 production. In opposition to our hypotheses, sulfate amendments did not increase rates of sulfate reduction, increase CO2 production, or decrease CH4 production over a 2-yr period, but did increase both sulfate pool sizes and residence times. Despite low rates of sulfate reduction compared to other freshwater wetlands, daily average sulfate reduction (1.7 mmol/m(2)) exceeded regional annual inputs of atmospheric sulfate deposition (1.6 mmol/m(2)). Between 77{\%} and 99{\%} of reduced sulfate was incorporated into the carbon-bonded sulfur pool, which turns over slowly. The slow turnover rate and comparatively low sulfate reduction rates may be related to the low iron content of the bog peat. Additionally, sulfate reduction initially was sulfate limited in the control plots, but with sulfur amendments, the sulfate limitation was removed; sulfate reduction appeared to be limited by some other factor, possibly labile carbon. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction was more important to total anaerobic carbon mineralization than methane production, although neither process dominated overall anaerobic carbon mineralization ({\textless}2{\%} of total). Fermentation appeared to be the dominant anaerobic carbon mineralization pathway at Bleak Lake Bog, yet the mechanisms of how this process affects the carbon balance of peatlands has never been evaluated. Overall, our results suggest that, in at least the short term, soil carbon turnover in peatlands will not be enhanced by increased atmospheric sulfur deposition. If we want to understand the controlling factors on soil carbon storage in sites like Bleak Lake Bog, we should begin to examine anaerobic carbon mineralization via fermentation pathways.},

abstract = {In recent years, a strong debate has emerged in the hydrologic literature regarding what constitutes an appropriate framework for uncertainty estimation. Partic- ularly, there is strong disagreement whether an uncertainty framework should have its roots within a proper statistical (Bayesian) context, or whether such a framework should be based on a different philosophy and implement informal measures and weaker inference to summarize parameter and predictive distributions. In this paper, we compare a formal Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) for assessing uncertainty in conceptual watershed modeling. Our formal Bayesian approach is implemented using the recently developed differential evolution adaptive metropolis (DREAM) MCMC scheme with a likelihood function that explicitly considers model structural, input and parameter uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that DREAM and GLUE can generate very similar estimates of total streamflow uncertainty. This suggests that formal and informal Bayesian approaches have more common ground than the hydrologic literature and ongoing debate might suggest. The main advantage of formal approaches is, however, that they attempt to dis- entangle the effect of forcing, parameter and model structural error on total predictive uncertainty. This is key to improving hydrologic theory and to better understand and predict the flow of water through catchments.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference has found widespread application and use in science and engineering to reconcile Earth system models with data, including prediction in space (interpolation), prediction in time (forecasting), assimilation of observations and deterministic/stochastic model output, and inference of the model parameters. Bayes theorem states that the posterior probability, p(H|Y˜) of a hypothesis, H is proportional to the product of the prior probability, p(H) of this hypothesis and the likelihood, L(H|Y˜) of the same hypothesis given the new observations, Y˜, or p(H|Y˜)∝p(H)L(H|Y˜). In science and engineering, H often constitutes some numerical model, ℱ(x) which summarizes, in algebraic and differential equations, state variables and fluxes, all knowledge of the system of interest, and the unknown parameter values, x are subject to inference using the data Y˜. Unfortunately, for complex system models the posterior distribution is often high dimensional and analytically intractable, and sampling methods are required to approximate the target. In this paper I review the basic theory of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and introduce a MATLAB toolbox of the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm developed by Vrugt et al. (2008a, 2009a) and used for Bayesian inference in fields ranging from physics, chemistry and engineering, to ecology, hydrology, and geophysics. This MATLAB toolbox provides scientists and engineers with an arsenal of options and utilities to solve posterior sampling problems involving (among others) bimodality, high-dimensionality, summary statistics, bounded parameter spaces, dynamic simulation models, formal/informal likelihood functions (GLUE), diagnostic model evaluation, data assimilation, Bayesian model averaging, distributed computation, and informative/noninformative prior distributions. The DREAM toolbox supports parallel computing and includes tools for convergence analysis of the sampled chain trajectories and post-processing of the results. Seven different case studies illustrate the main capabilities and functionalities of the MATLAB toolbox.},

abstract = {Entrapped gas bubbles in peat can alter the buoyancy, storativity, void ratio and expansion/contraction properties of the peat. Moreover, when gas bubbles block water-conducting pores they can significantly reduce saturated hydraulic conductivity and create zones of over-pressuring, perhaps leading to an alteration in the magnitude and direction of groundwater flow and solute transport. Some previous researches have demonstrated that these zones of over-pressuring are not observed by the measurements of pore-water pressures using open-pipe piezometers in peat; rather, they are only observed with pressure transducers sealed in the peat. In has been hypothesized that open-pipe piezometers vent entrapped CH4 to the atmosphere and thereby do not permit the natural development of zones of entrapped gas. Here we present findings of the study to investigate whether piezometers vent subsurface CH4 to the atmosphere and whether the presence of piezometers alters the subsurface concentration of dissolved CH4. We measured the flux of methane venting from the piezometers and also determined changes in pore-water CH4 concentration at a rich fen in southern Ontario and a poor fen in southern Quebec, in the summer of 2004. Seasonally averaged CH4 flux from piezometers was 1450 and 37{\textperiodcentered}8-mg CH4 m−2 d−1 at the southern Ontario site and Quebec site, respectively. The flux at the Ontario site was two orders of magnitude greater than the diffusive flux at the site. CH4 pore-water concentrations were significantly lower in open piezometers than in water taken from sealed samplers at both the Ontario and Quebec sites. The flux of CH4 from piezometers decreased throughout the season suggesting that CH4 venting through the piezometer exceeded the rate of methanogenesis in the peat. Consequently we conclude that piezometers may alter the gas dynamics of some peatlands. We suggest that less-invasive techniques (e.g. buried pressure transducers, tracer experiments) are needed for the accurate measurement of pore-water pressures and hydraulic conductivity in peatlands with a large entrapped gas component. Furthermore, we argue that caution must be made in interpreting results from previous peatland hydrology studies that use these traditional methods.

abstract = {There is growing recognition that changes in vegetation composition can strongly influence peatland carbon cycling, with potential feedbacks to future climate. Nevertheless, despite accelerated climate and vegetation change in this ecosystem, the growth responses of peatland plant species to combined warming and vegetation change are unknown. Here, we used a field warming and vegetation removal experiment to test the hypothesis that dominant species from the three plant functional types present (dwarf-shrubs: Calluna vulgaris; graminoids: Eriophorum vaginatum; bryophytes: Sphagnum capillifolium) contrast in their growth responses to warming and the presence or absence of other plant functional types. Warming was accomplished using open top chambers, which raised air temperature by approximately 0.35 °C, and we measured air and soil microclimate as potential mechanisms through which both experimental factors could influence growth. We found that only Calluna growth increased with experimental warming (by 20 {\%}), whereas the presence of dwarf-shrubs and bryophytes increased growth of Sphagnum (46 {\%}) and Eriophorum (20 {\%}), respectively. Sphagnum growth was also negatively related to soil temperature, which was lower when dwarf-shrubs were present. Dwarf-shrubs may therefore promote Sphagnum growth by cooling the peat surface. Conversely, the effect of bryophyte presence on Eriophorum growth was not related to any change in microclimate, suggesting other factors play a role. In conclusion, our findings reveal contrasting abiotic and biotic controls over dominant peatland plant growth, suggesting that community composition and carbon cycling could be modified by simultaneous climate and vegetation change.},

abstract = {The northern terrestrial net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) is contingent on inputs from vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) to offset the ecosystem respiration (Reco) of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions, but an effective framework to monitor the regional Arctic NECB is lacking. We modified a terrestrial carbon flux (TCF) model developed for satellite remote sensing applications to evaluate wetland CO2 and CH4 fluxes over pan-Arctic eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites. The TCF model estimates GPP, CO2 and CH4 emissions using in situ or remote sensing and reanalysis-based climate data as inputs. The TCF model simulations using in situ data explained {\textgreater} 70{\%} of the r2 variability in the 8 day cumulative EC measured fluxes. Model simulations using coarser satellite (MODIS) and reanalysis (MERRA) records accounted for approximately 69{\%} and 75{\%} of the respective r2 variability in the tower CO2 and CH4 records, with corresponding RMSE uncertainties of {\&}leq; 1.3 g C m−2 d−1 (CO2) and 18.2 mg C m−2 d−1 (CH4). Although the estimated annual CH4 emissions were small (−2 yr−1) relative to Reco ({\textgreater} 180 g C m−2 yr−1), they reduced the across-site NECB by 23{\%} and contributed to a global warming potential of approximately 165 ± 128 g CO2eq m−2 yr−1 when considered over a 100 year time span. This model evaluation indicates a strong potential for using the TCF model approach to document landscape-scale variability in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and to estimate the NECB for northern peatland and tundra ecosystems.},

abstract = {As the global climate changes so will the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and release from peatlands. The changes occurring within peatlands will be complex, making their future carbon (C) responses difficult to predict. We studied three boreal fen peatlands along a nutrient gradient in northern Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we investigated how abiotic and biotic responses of the fens interacted with seasonal and annual hydrologic variability. We further assessed the role that a local disturbance, such as inundation due to beaver dams, has in confounding fen C dynamics. We conducted these assessments by applying the process-based model Wetland-DNDC, which we parameterized, calibrated and corroborated with field data, to examine how C dynamics were affected by fen type (rich, intermediate and poor), historical and projected climate and local flooding disturbance. We found inter-annual variability in greenhouse gas (CO2 and methane, CH4) dynamics to be large among fens, with larger coefficients of variation for heterotrophic respiration and CH4 effluxes (a range of 40–85{\%} and 31–58{\%}, respectively) than gross primary production (a range of 9–26{\%}). This annual variability in C effluxes correlated to meteorological conditions and water table, although the specific drivers differed among fens. Scenarios of prolonged flooding and drought had opposite effects on C effluxes. Drought increased CO2 efflux by 43{\%}, 175{\%} and 65{\%} for rich, intermediate and poor fens, respectively, and decreased CH4 efflux by 11{\%} and 14{\%} for the intermediate and poor, but increased CH4 efflux by 19{\%} for the rich fen. In contrast, shallow flooding decreased CO2 by 40{\%}, 72{\%} and 57{\%} in the rich, intermediate and poor fen, and increased CH4 effluxes by 87{\%}, 202{\%} and 269{\%}, respectively. Flooding by beaver dams during a prolonged drought moderately decreased CO2 (29{\%}, 66{\%} and 53{\%}) but strongly increased CH4 efflux by 121{\%}, 261{\%} and 333{\%}, respectively, than the flooding only. We conclude that the interacting controls on greenhouse gas dynamics differ among fens types, contributing to the magnitude of effluxes and their response to changing conditions. We propose that effects of water table level, peat nutrient status, and vegetation composition, and their interactions, on C processes require enhanced understanding to define natural ranges of spatial and temporal variability. Only then will it be possible to adequately predict future peatland C responses to climate and other environmental changes. As such, short-term experimental results or field studies should not be used to predict future peatland C dynamics without an understanding of the natural range of variation in the environmental drivers and the response of C processes to those drivers.},

The depths of each different peat type were found to vary widely with means of 192 {\{}+/-{\}} 100, 145 {\{}+/-{\}} 130 and 127 {\{}+/-{\}} 100 cm for raised bogs (RB), high-level blanket bog (HLB) and low-level blanket bog (LLB), respectively. Based on the full-surveyed depth, we estimated carbon densities of: 1160 {\{}+/-{\}} 520 Mg C ha-1 for RB peat; 775 {\{}+/-{\}} 590 Mg C ha-1 for HLB peat and 705 {\{}+/-{\}} 420 Mg C ha-1 for LLB peat. We found peat depth and peat type to be significant predictors of peat carbon density and present pedo-transfer functions for carbon density based on these predictors that will help to improve future peat C stock estimates. We suggest that due to the similarities between the carbon densities of the HLB and LLB, they can be analysed as one group for accounting purposes and future C stock estimates.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the atmosphere and a subalpine wetland located in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, at 3200 m elevation were measured during 1996-1998. Respiration, net CO2 flux, and CH4 flux were measured using the closed chamber method during snow-free periods and using gas diffusion calculations during snow-covered periods. The ranges of measured flux were 1.2-526 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (respiration), -1056-100 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (net CO2 exchange), and 0.1-36.8 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (a positive value represents efflux to the atmosphere). Respiration and CH4 emission were significantly correlated with 5 cm soil temperature. Annual respiration and CH4 emission were modeled by applying the flux-temperature relationships to a continuous soil temperature record during 1996-1998. Gross photosynthesis was modeled using a hyperbolic equation relating gross photosynthesis, photon flux density, and soil temperature. Modeled annual flux estimates indicate that the wetland was a net source of carbon gas to the atmosphere each of the three years: 8.9 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1996, 9.5 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1997, and 9.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1998. This contrasts with the long-term carbon accumulation of similar to0.7 mol m(-2) yr(-1) determined from C analyses of a peat core collected from the wetland.},

abstract = {Estimation and mapping of soil organic carbon storage in three dimensions for large areas is increasingly in demand for climate change reporting, but such estimates at large spatial scales and different soil depths are generally time consuming and expensive. This paper investigates the potential to reduce the number of required soil observations to one point close to the soil surface by applying negative exponential vertical depth functions of soil carbon distribution. This approach assumes that the carbon content at a depth of 1m, under relatively stable vegetation conditions, can be functionally related to the concentration at the soil surface in the absence of major recent disturbances (e.g. landslides, soil stock piling, etc.). Vertical distribution functions were developed for 38 soil profiles in the Midlands area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and normalized using the value observed close to the surface, followed by the grouping of soils with similar vertical distribution patterns. Normalization reduced the number of model parameters and enabled the multiplication of the exponential decline curve characteristics with a soil carbon stock value observed at the surface to represent an adequately represented value of soil carbon distribution to 1m at that observation point. The integral of the exponential function was used to calculate the soil carbon storage and raster layers were developed for each of the parameters in the integral to map soil carbon storage to 1m. The exponential decline function adequately fits the soil carbon data and is shown to relate to soil type. The resultant maps predicted soil organic carbon stocks to 1m in forest plantations and grasslands to vary from 19 to 46km{\textperiodcentered}m−2.},

abstract = {A model is presented which aims at quantifying the CO(2) and H(2)O gas exchange of whole plants in their natural microenvironment, the canopy. In an up-scaling approach the model combines leaf (gas exchange, energy balance) and canopy (radiative transfer, wind attenuation) scale simulations. Net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are modelled using a nitrogen sensitive model of leaf gas exchange. An analytical solution to the energy balance equation is adopted to calculate leaf temperatures. Radiative transfer, separately for the wavebands of photosynthetically active, near-infrared and long-wave radiation, is simulated by means of a model which accounts for multiple scattering of radiation using detailed information on canopy structure as input data. partial pressures of CO(2) and H(2)O, as well as air temperatures within the canopy are not modelled, but instead, measured values are used as input data. Field studies were carried out at the ECOMONT pilot study area Monte Bondone (Trentino, Italy, 1550 m a.s.l.). The model is parametrised for four forbs and one graminoid species occurring at three sites differing in land use, i.e. an abandoned area, a meadow and a pasture.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, alkalinity and calcium were measured in weekly samples, with particulate organic carbon (POC) measured from the suspended sediment load from the stream outlet of an 11.4-km(2) catchment. For calendar year 1999, regular monitoring of the catchment was supplemented with detailed quasi-continuous measurements of flow and stream temperature, and DOC for the months September through November. The measurements were used to calculate the annual flux of dissolved CO(2), dissolved inorganic carbon, DOC and POC from the catchment and were combined with CO(2) and CH(4) gaseous exchanges calculated from previously published values and the observations of water table height within the peat. The study catchment represents a net sink of 15.4+/-11.9 gC/m(2)/yr. Carbon flows calculated for the study catchment are combined with values in the literature, using a Monte Carlo method, to estimate the carbon budget for British upland peat. For all British upland peat the calculation suggests a net carbon sink of between 0.15 and 0.29 MtC/yr. This is the first study to include a comprehensive study of the fluvial export of carbon within carbon budgets and shows the size of the peat carbon sink to be smaller than previous estimates, although sensitivity analysis shows that the primary productivity rather than fluvial carbon flux is a more important element in estimating the carbon budget in this regard.},

abstract = {Peatlands contain approximately 25{\%} of the global soil carbon (C), despite covering only 3{\%} of the earth's land surface. In order to evaluate the role of peatlands in global C cycling, models of ecosystem biogeochemistry are required, but peatland ecosystems present a number of unique challenges, particularly how to deal with the large variability that occurs at scales of one to several metres. In models, spatial variability is considered either explicitly for each individual unit and the outputs averaged, referred to as flux upscaling, or implicitly by weighting model parameters by the fractional occurrence of the individual units, referred to as parameter upscaling. The advantage of parameter upscaling is that it is much more computationally efficient: a requirement for hemispheric scale simulations. In this study we determined the differences between modelling a raised bog peatland with hummock-hollow microtopography using flux and parameter upscaling. We used the McGill Wetland Model (MWM), a process-based ecosystem C model for peatlands, configured for hummocks and hollows separately and then a weighted mixture of both. The simulated output based on flux and parameter upscaling was compared with eddy-covariance tower measurements. We found that net ecosystem production (NEP) for hollows was much larger than that for hummocks because total ecosystem respiration (TER) for hummocks was greater while gross primary production (GPP) did not differ significantly between the two topographic features. However, despite differences in components of NEP between hummocks and hollows, there was no statistically significant difference between the NEP based on flux and parameter upscaling using the MWM. Both flux and parameter upscaling show equivalent capability to capture the magnitude, direction, seasonality and inter-annual variability. The root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) are 0.66, 0.45, and 0.49g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively for GPP, TER and NEP based on the flux upscaling, while 0.67, 0.44, and 0.48 gC m(-2) day(-1), respectively based on the parameter upscaling. The degree of agreement (d*) is 0.96, 0.97, and 0.88, respectively for GPP, TER and NEP based on the flux upscaling, while 0.96, 0.97, and 0.89, respectively based on the parameter upscaling. This result suggests that differences in processes caused by peatland microtopography scale linearly, which means an ecosystem-level model set-up (i.e. parameter upscaling scheme), is sufficient to simulate the C cycling.

abstract = {Northern peatlands store similar to 30{\%} of the global soil carbon, despite covering only 3{\%} of the land. To understand the carbon balance of these systems and predict their response to changes in climate, robust and reliable models are needed. The McGill Wetland Model (MWM), originally developed to simulate the carbon dynamics of ombrotrophic bogs, was modified to simulate the CO2 biogeochemistry of sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatlands, a prominent peatland type in boreal and subarctic landscapes. Three modifications were implemented: (1) a function to describe the impact of soil moisture on the optimal gross primary production, (2) a scheme to partition the peat profile into oxic and anoxic compartments based on the effective root depth as a function of daily sedge net primary production, and (3) a function to describe the fen moss water dynamics. The modified MWM was evaluated using eddy-covariance net ecosystem production (NEP) from Degero Stormyr in northern Sweden. The root mean square error for daily NEP was similar to 0.46g C m(-2) d(-1), and the index of agreement was 84{\%}. This model adequately captures the magnitude and direction of the CO2 fluxes and simulates the seasonal and inter-annual variability reasonably well (r(2){\textgreater}0.8). Sensitivity analysis confirms that specifically water table depth (WTD) and moss water content are key biogeochemical hydrology processes for the carbon biogeochemistry of a sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatland. An increase of WTD by 15cm or air temperature by 3 degrees C could decrease NEP by up to 200{\%} and make the peatland become a source of CO2.},

abstract = {In this study, a quasi-three-dimensional, variably saturated groundwater flow model was developed by approximately dividing the three-dimensional soil water and groundwater flow into an unsaturated vertical soil water flow and a horizontal groundwater flow to simulate the interactions among soil water, groundwater, and vegetation. The developed model consists of a one-dimensional unsaturated soil water flow model with the water table as the moving boundary using an adaptive grid structure for a vertical soil column formed based on discrete grid cells in a horizontal domain, a two-dimensional groundwater flow model for the horizontal domain, and an interface model connecting the two components for the horizontal grid cells in the domain. Synthetic experiments by the model were conducted to test the sensitivities of the model parameters of river elevation, ground surface hydraulic conductivity, and surface flux, and the results from the experiments showed the robustness of the proposed model under different conditions. Comparison of the simulation by the model and that by a full three-dimensional scheme showed its feasibility and efficiency. A case of stream water conveyance in the lower reaches of the Tarim River was then applied to validate the developed model for simulation of the water table elevations at the Yingsu section. Finally, a numerical experiment by the model for the Tarim River basin was conducted to discuss the groundwater latent flow for large-scale high-relief topography with stream water conveyance. The results show that the model can simulate the water table reasonably well.},

abstract = {Rates of organic carbon mineralization (to CO2 and CH4) vary widely in peat soil. We transplanted four peat soils with different chemical composition into six sites with different environmental conditions to help resolve the debate about control of organic carbon mineralization by resource availability (e.g. carbon and nutrient chemistry) versus environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, moisture, pH). The four peat soils were derived from Sphagnum (bog moss). Two transplant sites were in mid-boreal Alberta, Canada, two were in low-boreal Ontario, Canada, and two were in the temperate United States. After 3 years in the field, CH4 production varied significantly as a function of peat type, transplant site, and the type–site interaction. All four peat soils had very small rates of CH4 production ({\textless}20nmol g1 day1) after transplant into two sites, presumably caused by acid site conditions (pH{\textless}4.0). One peat soil had small CH4 production rates regardless of transplant site. A canonical discriminant analysis revealed that large rates of CH4 production (4000nmol g1 day1) correlated with large holocellulose content, a large concentration of p-hydroxyl phenolic compounds in the Klason lignin, and small concentrations of N, Ca and Mn in peat. Significant variation in rates of CO2 production correlated positively with holocellulose content and negatively with N concentrations, regardless of transplant site. The temperature response for CO2 production varied as a function of climate, being greater for peat formed in a cold climate, but did not apply to transplanted peat. Although we succeeded in elucidating some aspects of peat chemistry controlling production of CH4 and CO2 in Sphagnum-derived peat soils, we also revealed idiosyncratic combinations of peat chemistry and site conditions that will complicate forecasting rates of peat carbon mineralization into the future.},

abstract = {Peatlands contain a large belowground carbon (C) stock in the biosphere, and their dynamics have important implications for the global carbon cycle. However, there are still large uncertainties in C stock estimates and poor understanding of C dynamics across timescales. Here I review different approaches and associated uncertainties of C stock estimates in the literature, and on the basis of the literature review my best estimate of C stocks and uncertainty is 500+/-100 (approximate range) gigatons of C (GtC) in northern peatlands. The greatest source of uncertainty for all the approaches is the lack or insufficient representation of data, including depth, bulk density and carbon accumulation data, especially from the world's large peatlands. Several ways to improve estimates of peat carbon stocks are also discussed in this paper, including the estimates of C stocks by regions and further utilizations of widely available basal peat ages. Changes in peatland carbon stocks over time, estimated using Sphagnum (peat moss) spore data and down-core peat accumulation records, show different patterns during the Holocene, and I argue that spore-based approach underestimates the abundance of peatlands in their early histories. Considering long-term peat decomposition using peat accumulation data allows estimates of net carbon sequestration rates by peatlands, or net (ecosystem) carbon balance (NECB), which indicates more than half of peat carbon ({\textgreater} 270 Gt C) was sequestrated before 7000 yr ago during the Holocene. Contemporary carbon flux studies at 5 peatland sites show much larger NECB during the last decade (32+/-7.8 (S.E.) g Cm-2 yr(-1)) than during the last 7000 yr (+/-11 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), as modeled from peat records across northern peatlands. This discrepancy highlights the urgent need for carbon accumulation data and process understanding, especially at decadal and centennial timescales, that would bridge current knowledge gaps and facilitate comparisons of NECB across all timescales.},

abstract = {A snow accumulation and melt module implemented in the GEOTOP model is presented and tested. GEOTOP, a distributed model of the hydrological cycle, based on digital elevation models (DEMs), calculates the discharge at the basin outlet and estimates the local and distributed values of several hydro-meteorological quantities. It solves the energy and the mass balance jointly and deals accurately with the effects of topography on the interactions among radiation physics, energy balance and the hydrological cycle. Soil properties are considered to depend on soil temperature and moisture, and the heat and water transfer in the soil is modelled using a multilayer approach. The snow module solves for the soil-snow energy and mass exchanges, and, together with a runoff production module, is embedded in a more general energy balance model that provides all the boundary conditions required. The snowpack is schematized as a single snow layer where a limited number of physical processes are described. The module can be seen essentially as a parameter-free model. The application to an alpine catchment (Rio Valbiolo, Trentino, Italy), monitored by an in situ snow-depth sensor, is discussed and shown to give results comparable to those of more complex models.

abstract = {Increased nitrogen (N) deposition within the context of both warming and grazing is relevant to understand the response of greenhouse gases fluxes (GHG) (i.e. CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes) for alpine meadow ecosystems to projected changes in the environment. A previous controlled warming and grazing experiment only included no warming with no grazing (NWNG), no warming with grazing (NWG), warming with no grazing (WNG) and warming with grazing (WG) from 2006 to 2010. N fertilization was added to the experimental setup to determine the effects of warming, grazing and N fertilization on GHG fluxes in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau during the growing seasons from 2010 to 2012. Sheep grazing was utilized during the growing season from 2006 to 2010 and cutting was used as simulation of grazing during the non-growing seasons in 2011 and 2012. Warming significantly increased average seasonal CO2 emission by 10{\%}, and nitrogen addition increased average seasonal CH4 uptake by 14{\%} during the growing seasons in the dry years of 2011 and 2012. Warming increased average seasonal CH4 uptake by 32–46{\%} over the 3-year period, and grazing increased annual average N2O emission by 62{\%} only in 2010. N fertilization alone did not significantly affect CO2 and N2O fluxes during the experimental period. The interactive effects of warming, grazing/cutting and N fertilization effect on daily CH4 or daily N2O flux depended on sampling date. Ecosystem CO2 emission was mainly affected by soil temperature and plant aboveground net primary production (ANPP), which explained about 55{\%} and 18{\%} of its variation. Soil moisture and ANPP could explain 17{\%} and 8{\%} of the variation of CH4 uptake in the region. Our results suggest that the stimulating effect of warming on ecosystem respiration still occurs in 2011 and 2012 after warming for seven years. Moreover, our results imply that moderate grazing/cutting may be preferred compared with no grazing or no cutting because its negative effect on GHG fluxes was small, and interactive effect of warming, grazing/cutting and increased N deposition on GHG emission could be neglected in the alpine meadow.},

abstract = {Arctic terrestrial ecosystems are major global sources of methane (CH4); hence, it is important to understand the seasonal and climatic controls on CH4 emissions from these systems. Here, we report year-round CH4 emissions from Alaskan Arctic tundra eddy flux sites and regional fluxes derived from aircraft data. We find that emissions during the cold season (September to May) account for ≥50{\%} of the annual CH4 flux, with the highest emissions from noninundated upland tundra. A major fraction of cold season emissions occur during the "zero curtain" period, when subsurface soil temperatures are poised near 0 °C. The zero curtain may persist longer than the growing season, and CH4 emissions are enhanced when the duration is extended by a deep thawed layer as can occur with thick snow cover. Regional scale fluxes of CH4 derived from aircraft data demonstrate the large spatial extent of late season CH4 emissions. Scaled to the circumpolar Arctic, cold season fluxes from tundra total 12 ± 5 (95{\%} confidence interval) Tg CH4 y(-1), ∼25{\%} of global emissions from extratropical wetlands, or ∼6{\%} of total global wetland methane emissions. The dominance of late-season emissions, sensitivity to soil environmental conditions, and importance of dry tundra are not currently simulated in most global climate models. Because Arctic warming disproportionally impacts the cold season, our results suggest that higher cold-season CH4 emissions will result from observed and predicted increases in snow thickness, active layer depth, and soil temperature, representing important positive feedbacks on climate warming.},
